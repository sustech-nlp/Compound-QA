Additionally, the positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for diagnosing the site of infection was found to be 100%, indicating that a more comprehensive surgical approach may lead to better outcomes for patients with both mitral and aortic prostheses infected with PVE."}

VCE does not require sedation or the passage of any instruments through the body, making it potentially more accessible and less resource-intensive in a community healthcare setting.\n\nOverall, each procedure has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice between DBE and VCE should be based on the specific clinical context, patient factors, and available resources in a given healthcare setting."}

Ten fresh cadaveric knees were utilized. The intra-osseous length can be measured with a specially de - signed flexible guide pin. Flexible pins were inserted with the knee at 70°, 90°, and 120° of flexion. The intra-osseous length was measured with the measuring device. Each speci - men was dissected around the lateral aspect of the knee to identify the critical structures, the common peroneal nerve, and the LCL. The distance from the guide pins to the com - mon peroneal nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL were measured with a standard flexible paper ruler to the nearest millimeter. There is a trend for progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated with increased flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70° flexion was 25.2 mm (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared to mean intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to 45 mm) in the 90° and 120° flexion groups, respectively (p<0.05).

{"ID": "pubmed_qa_50", "context": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed by non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation) reactions, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including normoglycemic uremia. AGE research in uremia has focused on the accumulation of carbohydrate-derived adducts generated by the Maillard reaction. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that one AGE, the glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CML), could be derived not only from carbohydrates but also from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro, raising the possibility that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation might be increased in uremia. To address this hypothesis, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography to measure protein adducts formed in uremic plasma by reactions between carbonyl compounds and protein amino groups: pentosidine derived from carbohydrate-derived carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA)-lysine derived from lipid-derived carbonyls, and CML originating possibly from both sources. All three adducts were elevated in uremic plasma. Plasma CML levels were mainly (>95%) albumin bound. Their levels were not correlated with fructoselysine levels and were similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients on hemodialysis, indicating that their increase was not driven by glucose. Pentosidine and MDA-lysine were also increased in plasma to the same extent in diabetic and non-diabetic hemodialysis patients. Statistical analysis indicated that plasma levels of CML correlated weakly (P<0.05) with those of pentosidine and MDA-lysine, but that pentosidine and MDA-lysine varied independently (P>0.5).", "com_question": "In contrast to the formation of pentosidine and MDA-lysine, how does CML production in uremic plasma differ?

The similarity in levels between diabetic and non-diabetic patients on hemodialysis further suggests that the increase in pentosidine and MDA-lysine was not driven by glucose, pointing towards a higher overall oxidative stress in uremia related to lipid-derived carbonyls."}

Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl. 48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5 ng/ml, (range 0.5 ng/ml to >40 ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9 ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3 ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1 ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected. The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether the presence of severe pain immediately after vertebroplasty predicts short- and long-term pain relief. A chart review was performed to categorize patients regarding pain severity and analgesic usage immediately after vertebroplasty (<4 h). \"Severe\" pain was defined as at least 8 of 10 with the 10-point VAS. Outcomes were pain severity and pain medication score and usage at 1 month and 1 year after vertebroplasty.

Of the 429 vertebroplasty procedures identified, 69 (16%) were associated with severe pain, and 133 (31%) were associated with analgesic administration immediately after the procedure. The group experiencing severe pain had higher preprocedure median VAS rest pain scores (5 [IQR, 2-7]) and activitypain scores (10 [IQR, 8-10]) compared with patients who did not experience severe pain (3 [IQR, 1-6]; P = .0208, and 8 [IQR, 7-10]; P = .0263, respectively). At 1 month postprocedure, VAS rest and activity pain scores were similar between the severe pain group and the nonsevere pain group (P = .16 and P = .25, respectively) and between the group receiving pain medication and the group not receiving pain medication (P = .25 and P = .67, respectively). This similarity continued for 1 year after the procedure.

All women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [≥2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed. Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118).

The data suggests that only 1.3% of colorectal cancers were potentially missed adenomas that were not detected during previous endoscopy procedures.\n\nSeveral factors can influence the detection rate of missed adenomas in patients undergoing endoscopy, including:\n\n1. Quality of the initial endoscopy: The thoroughness and accuracy of the initial endoscopy play a significant role in detecting potential adenomas. Adequate training and experience of the endoscopist can also impact detection rates.\n\n2. Interval between endoscopies: The timing of follow-up endoscopies is crucial in detecting any potential growth or changes in lesions. Regular surveillance and adherence to recommended screening guidelines can improve the chances of detecting missed adenomas.\n\n3. Patient-related factors: Patient characteristics such as age, gender, family history of colorectal cancer, and underlying health conditions can influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer from missed adenomas.\n\n4. Technological advances: Advances in endoscopic technology, such as high-definition imaging and the use of advanced screening techniques like chromoendoscopy, can improve adenoma detection rates during endoscopy.\n\nOverall, while missed adenomas can contribute to the development of colorectal cancer, early detection through regular surveillance and improvements in endoscopic techniques can help reduce the risk of missed adenomas and improve patient outcomes."}

This study aims to explore Jordanian men's individual and contextual perspectives on women's breast cancer and their own role in the breast health of the females within their families. An explorative qualitative design was used to purposively recruit 24 married men aged 27 to 65 years (median 43 years) from four governorates in Jordan. Data in the form of interviews transcriptions was subjected to qualitative content analysis. Three themes were identified: a) Supporting one's wife; b) Marital needs and obligations; c) Constrained by a culture of destiny and shame. The first theme was built on men's feelings of responsibility for the family's health and well-being, their experiences of encouraging their wives to seek health care and their providing counselling and instrumental support. The second theme emerged from men's views about other men's rejection of a wife inflicted by breast cancer, their own perceptions of diminished femininity due to mastectomy and their own concerns about protecting the family from the hereditary risk of breast cancer. The third theme was seen in men's perception of breast cancer as an inevitable act of God that is far away from one's own family, in associating breast cancer with improper behaviour and in their readiness to face the culture of Eib (shame).", "com_question": "In contrast to rejecting breast cancer, how do Jordanian men perceive their role in supporting women's breast health?

This perspective of supporting their wives offers a more effective approach to promoting female well-being within their families compared to rejecting breast cancer.\n\nBy actively participating in their wives' breast health and well-being, Jordanian men can contribute to early detection, encourage screening practices, and provide emotional support to their spouses. This proactive approach can lead to increased awareness, improved access to healthcare, and better health outcomes for women facing breast cancer or at risk of developing the disease. It also helps to break down cultural barriers and stigma surrounding breast health, creating a supportive and open environment within families that prioritizes women's health and well-being."}

One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding.", "com_question": "In children post-convulsive episodes, how do retinal haemorrhages compare with systemic disorders? Considering child abuse suspicion, which condition warrants further examination?", "com_reference": "In the study mentioned in the passage, retinal hemorrhages following convulsive episodes were not commonly observed among the 153 children studied. Only one child was found to have unilateral retinal hemorrhages post a simple febrile convulsion without any other identifiable cause. On the other hand, systemic disorders were likely more prevalent after convulsions, as the passage mentions that further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder in addition to child abuse when positive retinal findings were observed. Therefore, in this context, retinal hemorrhages seemed to be less common compared to systemic disorders following convulsive episodes. When retinal hemorrhages are suspected and found in a child post-convulsive episode, it is important to conduct a thorough investigation to rule out systemic disorders or child abuse, as the presence of retinal hemorrhages is considered characteristic of child abuse and warrants further examination to ensure the child's safety and well-being."}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the deformity angular ratio (DAR) can reliably assess the neurological risks of patients undergoing deformity correction. Identifying high-risk patients and procedures can help ensure that appropriate measures are taken to minimize neurological complications during spinal deformity corrections.

However, 2 curves of similar magnitude and location can have significantly different risks of neurological deficit during surgery. Whether the curve spans many levels or just a few can significantly influence surgical strategies. Lenke et al have proposed the DAR, which is a measure of curve magnitude per level of deformity. The data from 35 pediatric spinal deformity correction procedures with thoracic 3-column osteotomies were reviewed. Measurements from preoperative radiographs were used to calculate the DAR. Binary logistic regression was used to model the relationship between DARs (independent variables) and presence or absence of an intraoperative alert (dependent variable). In patients undergoing 3-column osteotomies, sagittal curve magnitude and total curve magnitude were associated with increased incidence of transcranial motor evoked potential changes.

Symptoms' progression:\n- The patient in this case experienced severe lower back and buttock pain upon the development of the lumbosacral subdural hematoma. The main symptom was sciatica, and the patient did not exhibit any other significant neurological deficits.\n- In contrast, when the SAH was primarily located in the posterior fossa, there were no reported neurological symptoms associated with the SSDH besides the pain.\n\n2.

Specifically, we asked which preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by faculty. Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate.

Higher specificity means that the GI method is better at correctly excluding non-drug-related events as compared to decisional algorithms, which may overestimate the causal relationship between drugs and adverse events. By utilizing the GI method, there is a lower risk of falsely attributing adverse events to drug causes when they are not truly drug-related."}

This initial score showed a closer correspondence between predicted and observed mortality rates compared to the APACHE II score calculated at ICU admission. Moreover, the differences in APACHE II scores between survivors and non-survivors were more statistically significant on day 10 postoperatively, emphasizing the importance of early risk assessment and monitoring in these patients."}

Twelve hypertrophied pig hearts underwent a protocol consisting of three 20-minute perfusion episodes (10 minutes NNAP and 10 minutes NNSP in a random order) with each conducted at a different blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD [100%, 50%, and 20% of its initial control]). Myocardial oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopic imaging. Myocardial energy metabolism was monitored using localized phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. With 100% LAD flow, both NNAP and NNSP maintained myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate at normal levels. When LAD flow was reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP resulted in a small but significant decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas those measurements did not change significantly during NNAP.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who presented with rattlesnake bites to a university teaching hospital during an 11-year period. From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected. Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality. We identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3).

The mean number of vials given for mild, moderate, and severe snakebites were 8.4, 11.8, and 18.7 respectively. Given that no deaths, amputations, or permanent disabilities occurred in patients receiving antivenin, it could be suggested that a dose tailored to the severity of the bite is most effective in managing symptoms while minimizing side effects. This approach allows for adequate treatment while reducing the risk of adverse reactions associated with higher doses."}

{"ID": "pubmed_qa_243", "context": "The \"health workforce\" crisis has led to an increased interest in health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as \"impact on workplace\" and \"impact on society,\" which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on societal health. This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors. Impact on the workplace was reported as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings.", "com_question": "Compared with the distance MPH program offered from South Africa, what is the impact on workplace and society of the residential program in the Netherlands, and which best fosters health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries?", "com_reference": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the impact on workplace and society of the residential program in the Netherlands includes changes in management and leadership roles, the development of leadership capacity valued by many graduates, introduction of workplace innovations, and wider impacts through advocacy, community engagement, and policy advisory roles.

The average Ki-67 value in our patients collectively (n = 77) is 34.9 ± 24.6%. The average Ki-67 value is the highest with 37.4 ± 24.0% in patients with a pCR. The Ki-67 values do not differ significantly among the 3 groups: pCR versus partial pathological response versus stable disease/progress (P = 0.896).

Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data. There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv).

{"ID": "pubmed_qa_269", "context": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "com_question": "In contrast to mitochondrial dynamics in animal PCD, how do the mitochondrial roles in lace plant PCD differ?

However, in lace plant PCD, the importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation seems to play a crucial role in remodelling lace plant leaves during PCD. This is indicated by the observation that in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment, which indirectly affects PTP formation, resulted in lace plant leaves with fewer perforations and displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells, suggesting the essential role of PTP in the PCD process in lace plants."}

{"ID": "pubmed_qa_296", "context": "Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective. We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation.

While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy. Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2]. We found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in average readers. Receptive vocabulary, a bilateral function, was preserved to a certain degree similar to that of strongly left-lateralized phonological skills [3].

This suggests that fMRI activation pattern in response to mental imagery tasks could serve as a better predictor of recovery for patients with consciousness disorders compared to traditional assessments like the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised.\n\nOverall, the study indicates that fMRI activation in response to mental imagery tasks can be a valuable tool in identifying the potential for recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness, with a high sensitivity and specificity in predicting outcomes compared to other methods."}

Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally. The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions.

Also, a thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) (n = 7) was made. A survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units was carried out to determine the practice for the withdrawal of blood for clotting studies. The median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 +/- 0.52 as compared to the median peripheral APTT ratio value which was 1.1 +/- 0.24 (P<0.001). INR values were statistically similar by both routes. Heparin contamination was confirmed by TEG which revealed that the R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase in the cup was higher (406.00 +/- 64.44 s) compared with the value for arterial samples with heparinase in the cup (318.28 +/- 47.26s, P<0.05). The survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units showed that heparinized arterial lines were by far the commonest ports used for blood withdrawal for the measurement of APTT ratio results.", "com_question": "In contrast to peripheral venous samples, how does arterial line sampling impact APTT ratio reliability post-cardiac surgery? Which blood withdrawal method is more reliable for APTT ratio testing in this context?", "com_reference": "Arterial line sampling post-cardiac surgery showed a higher median APTT ratio value compared to peripheral venous samples. The median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 ± 0.52, whereas the median peripheral APTT ratio value was 1.1 ± 0.24 (P<0.001). This indicates that arterial line sampling may lead to higher APTT ratio values, suggesting potential heparin contamination.\n\nBased on the findings presented in the passage, peripheral venous samples may be more reliable for APTT ratio testing post-cardiac surgery. This is because the arterial line sampling showed higher APTT ratio values due to potential heparin contamination, which may affect the reliability of the results."}

Recent studies have found direct associations between specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic information. Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's concordance index (1 - c-index). 548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2. By fitting Cox models and random survival forests, including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables, average 1 - c-index values were 0.221 (st.dev. 0.019) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 (st.dev. 0.018) for BRCA2 carriers.", "com_question": "How does the genetic SNP score compare with clinical/demographic variables in predicting risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, and which combination best enhances risk prediction accuracy?", "com_reference": "Based on the provided passage, the genetic SNP score was included alongside clinical/demographic variables in predicting risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.

The 1 - c-index represents Harrell's concordance index and is used to assess the predictive accuracy of models, with higher values indicating better predictive ability.\n\nThe results show that for BRCA1 carriers, the average 1 - c-index value was 0.221, and for BRCA2 carriers, it was 0.215. While the difference in values is minimal, it suggests that the genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables combined provide some predictive ability for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. However, it should be noted that neither value is particularly high, indicating there is room for improvement in the risk prediction models.\n\nTo determine which combination best enhances risk prediction accuracy, further analysis or comparison of different combinations of genetic SNP scores and clinical/demographic variables would be required. Additionally, considering the reported standard deviations for the 1 - c-index values, it may be beneficial to investigate the variability in prediction accuracy across different combinations of variables to identify the most robust predictive model for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers."}

We hypothesized that if the inflammation of the airway wall influences to some extent and in some way the PD in asthma patients, ICSs reverse the effect of airway inflammation on the PD. We studied 100 asthma patients who were divided into the following four groups: patients with obstruction who were either ICS-naive (group I) or were treated with ICSs (group II); and nonobstructed patients who were either ICS-naive (group III) or were treated with ICSs (group IV). PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed. Regression analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and factor analysis were applied for statistical evaluation. For a 5 to 20% fall in FEV(1) from the lowest point after saline solution induction, VAS score was lowest in group II, slightly higher in group I, slightly higher still in group IV, and the highest in group III. In the patients as a whole, BHR related to PD, but age, clinical score, duration of the disease, and presence of baseline airway obstruction did not. In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts related to PD negatively. Factor analysis yielded the following four factors that accounted for 70% of the variance in the data: ICS; eosinophil counts; FEV(1); and PC(20) loaded on separated factors with PD loading on the same factors as PC(20).

The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05).", "com_question": "In comparison to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging, how does the detection sensitivity of endometrial cancer with DW images differ, and what is the significance of the ADC values in distinguishing cancerous tissue?", "com_reference": "In the study mentioned, the detection sensitivity of endometrial cancer with DW images was found to be higher than with conventional nonenhanced MR imaging. Specifically, the detection sensitivity increased from 83% with T2-weighted images alone to 96% when DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were added. This indicates that incorporating DW imaging can improve the ability to detect endometrial cancer.\n\nThe apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values play a significant role in distinguishing cancerous tissue from normal tissues in this study. The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer was found to be significantly lower than those of the normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma, and adenomyosis. This suggests that cancerous tissue exhibits restricted diffusion, resulting in lower ADC values. Therefore, measuring and comparing ADC values can help differentiate cancerous tissue from other tissue types, providing valuable information for diagnosing and characterizing uterine endometrial cancer."}

{"ID": "pubmed_qa_471", "context": "A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored. Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients.", "com_question": "In the perioperative setting, how does fondaparinux compare with traditional anticoagulants in terms of safety and efficacy?

Fondaparinux's long half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its perioperative use, especially in surgeries with a high risk of bleeding or when neuraxial anesthesia is employed.\n\nWhen comparing fondaparinux to traditional anticoagulants, such as low-molecular-weight heparin or i.v. unfractionated heparin, the optimal choice for perioperative bridging in high-risk surgeries may vary based on individual patient factors. Fondaparinux may be considered for use as a bridging agent when other options are not feasible, contraindicated, or have limited efficacy in specific patient populations, such as those with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.\n\nUltimately, the decision on the choice of anticoagulant for perioperative bridging should be tailored to the patient's specific clinical situation, considering factors such as bleeding risk, drug interactions, and individual response to anticoagulant therapy. Consulting with a healthcare provider familiar with the patient's medical history and surgical plan is recommended to determine the most appropriate anticoagulant strategy for perioperative bridging in high-risk surgeries."}

Data for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted. SEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes by the use of process-oriented performance measures.

However, generally speaking, bank loan interest rates for 2-5 year terms tend to be lower compared to dealer-financed car loans. Banks typically offer lower interest rates due to their lower cost of funds and larger market presence.\n\nComparing the two options, obtaining a bank loan for a 2-5 year term would likely present better overall cost savings compared to a dealer-financed car loan. This is because bank loans usually come with lower interest rates which can translate into reduced interest costs over the life of the loan. It is recommended to compare loan offers from different banks to ensure you are getting the best deal possible."}

{"ID": "fiqa_521", "context": "Wire transfers normally run through either the Fedwire system or the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). The process generally works like this: You approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money. You give the bank a certain code, either an international bank account number or one of several other standards, which informs the bank where to send the money.  The bank sends a message through a system like Fedwire to the receiving bank, along with settlement instructions.  This is where the process can get a bit tricky. For the wire transfer to work, the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other, or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver. If the sending bank sends the money to a third-party bank, the transaction is settled between them, and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third-party bank. This last transaction may be a wire transfer, ACH transfer, etc.  The Federal Reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the Federal Reserve. This allows them to use the Fed as the third-party bank referred to above. Interestingly enough, this is one of the significant ways in which the Fed makes a profit, because it, along with every other bank and routing agent in the process, collects a miniscule fee on this process.  You'll often find sources that state that Fedwire is only for transferring large transactions; while this is technically correct, it's important to understand that financial institutions don't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately. Although the orders are put in immediately, the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day, and even then they normally only settle the difference. So, if Chase owes Bank of America $1M, and Bank of America owes Chase $750K, they don't send these as two transactions; Chase simply credits BAC $250K.  You didn't specifically ask about ACH transfers, which as littleadv pointed out, are different from wire transfers, but since ACH transfers can often form a part of the whole process, I'll explain that process too. ACH is a payment processing system that works through the Federal Reserve system, among others. The Federal Reserve (through the Fedline and FedACH systems) is by far the largest payment processor.  The physical cash itself isn't transferred; in simple terms, the money is transferred through the ACH system between the accounts each bank maintains at the Federal Reserve.  Here is a simple example of how the process works (I'm summarizing the example from Wikipedia). Let's say that Bob has an account with Chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer, Stack Exchange, directly deposited into this account. Assume that Stack Exchange uses Bank of America as their bank.  Bob, the receiver, fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer, called the originator. Once the originator has the authorization, they create an entry with an Originating Depository Financial Institution, which acts as a middleman between a payment processor (like the Federal Reserve) and the originator. The ODFI ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations. In this example, Bank of America is the ODFI.  Bank of America (the ODFI) converts the transaction request into an ACH entry and submits it, through an ACH operator, to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI), which in this case is Chase bank. Chase credits (deposits) the paycheck in Bob's account.  The Federal Reserve fits into all of this in several ways. Through systems like Fedline and FedACH, the Fed acts as an ACH operator, and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the Federal Reserve, so it's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks.", "com_question": "In contrast to the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), how do wire transfers via the Fedwire system work? Which system is more commonly used for interbank money transfers?", "com_reference": "Wire transfers via the Fedwire system work directly between banks, with the Federal Reserve acting as the intermediary that facilitates the transfer of funds between the sending and receiving banks. This system is commonly used for large and time-sensitive interbank money transfers.\n\nOn the other hand, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) also facilitates interbank transfers, but it relies on a clearing house operated by a private organization to settle payments between banks. CHIPS is also commonly used for high-value transactions, but it operates slightly differently from Fedwire.\n\nOverall, while both Fedwire and CHIPS are used for interbank money transfers, Fedwire is generally more commonly used, especially for larger transactions that require immediate settlement."}

{"ID": "fiqa_531", "context": "\"The number one rule of thumb that will generally answer the \"\"is it taxable\"\" question for any money you may have or receive: \"\"Did you pay taxes on it already?\"\". Pretty much any money you actually get in your paycheck/DD has already been taxed (or at least the projected amount of tax has been withheld) is your money, to dispense with as you will (or according to your pre-arranged obligations, for most of it). Deposits paid are one such example; if you wrote a check or obtained a money order that they then cashed, that's still your money until it isn't; the contract states that it is being held effectively in escrow (though the landlord has free use of it so long as he can pony up according to the contract). Anything not used to pay for damages is yours, and you get it back. The ATM fee refund is trickier, but basically this is a benefit offered to you as a service by your bank. You front for the ATM fees incurred when withdrawing, and then those fees are refunded to you by your bank (effectively increasing the number of ATMs you can withdraw from \"\"for free\"\"). As long as there is no net income, it's treated like a mail-in rebate; you didn't gain any money, so there's nothing new to tax. There are a couple of specific exceptions to this otherwise overarching rule of thumb. One is Roth IRAs. Typically, on investments, you either pay income tax on the money going in and capital gains tax on the money coming out, or you pay nothing going in and income tax coming out. With a Roth, however, you pay income tax going in and nothing coming out, even though you're (eventually) getting back more than you put in.  Another is gifts. Whoever gave you the gift paid the taxes on it (or the money to buy it). However, if they give you a gift valued more than a certain limit (changes every year, and there's a lifetime limit), they have to pay an additional gift tax of 35% on any amount over the limit. That's taxing taxed income (usually).  There are other examples, but for the overwhelming majority of situations, if it's money you already had after any and all applicable taxes, it's not taxable even if you haven't seen that money for a while.\"", "com_question": "How does the taxation of money differ for earned income compared with gifts or Roth IRAs?

However, it's common practice for businesses to close the books once a year, and to consolidate outstanding balances.  When this happens, Equity ceases to be abstract and becomes a hard value: \"\"How much is the company worth at this moment?\"\", which has a definite, numeric value. When the books are opened fresh for a new business year, the Current Income and Current Expense amounts are zeroed out.

This is where X comes in, the starting (previous year's) equity.  This allows the Assets and Liabilities to be non-zero, while the (current) Income and Expenses are both still zeroed out.  The account which represents X in gnucash is called \"\"Equity\"\", and encompasses not only initial investments, but also the net increase & decreases from previous years.

{"ID": "fiqa_535", "context": "I can think of a few simple and quick techniques for timing the market over the long term, and they can be used individually or in combination with each other. There are also some additional techniques to give early warning of possible turns in the market. The first is using a Moving Average (MA) as an indication of when to sell. Simply if the price closes below the MA it is time to sell. Obviously if the period you are looking at is long term you would probably use a weekly or even monthly chart and use a relatively large period MA such as a 50 week or 100 week moving average. The longer the period the more the MA will lag behind the price but the less false signals and whipsawing there will be. As we are looking long term (5 years +) I would use a weekly chart with a 100 week Exponential MA. The second technique is using a Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator, which is a momentum indicator. The idea for timing the markets in the long term is to buy when the indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line. For long term investing I would use a 13 week EMA of the 52 week ROC (the EMA smooths out the ROC indicator to reduce the chance of false signals). The beauty of these two indicators is they can be used effectively together. Below are examples of using these two indicators in combination on the S&P500 and the Australian S&P ASX200 over the past 20 years.  S&P500 1995 to 2015  ASX200 1995 to 2015 If I was investing in an ETF tracking one of these indexes I would use these two indicators together by using the MA as an early warning system and maybe tighten any stop losses I have so that if the market takes a sudden turn downward the majority of my profits would be protected. I would then use the ROC Indicator to sell out completely out of the ETF when it crosses below zero or to buy back in when the ROC moves back above zero. As you can see in both charts the two indicators would have kept you out of the market during the worst of the downfalls in 2000 and 2008 for the S&P500 and 2008 for the ASX200. If there is a false signal that gets you out of the market you can quite easily get back in if the indicator goes back above zero. Using these indicators you would have gotten into the market 3 times and out of it twice for the S&P500 over a 20 year period. For the ASX200 you would have gone in 6 times and out 5 times, also over a 20 year period. For individual shares I would use the ROC indicator over the main index the shares belong to, to give an indication of when to be buying individual stocks and when to tighten stop losses and stay on the sidelines. My philosophy is to buy rising stocks in a rising market and sell falling stocks in a falling market. So if the ROC indicator is above zero I would be looking to buy fundamentally healthy stocks that are up-trending and place a 20% trailing stop loss on them. If I get stopped out of one stock then I would look to replace it with another as long as the ROC is still above zero. If the ROC indicator crosses below zero I would tighten my trailing stop losses to 5% and not buy any new stocks once I get stopped out. Some additional indicators I would use for individual stock would be trend lines and using the MACD as a momentum indicator. These two indicators can give you further early warning that the stock may be about to reverse from its current trend, so you can tighten your stop loss even if the ROC is still above zero. Here is an example chart to explain:  GEM.AX 3 Year Weekly Chart Basically if the price closes below the trend line it may be time to close out the position or at the very least tighten up your trailing stop loss to 5%. If the price breaks below an established uptrend line it may well be the end of the uptrend. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows. As GEM has broken below the uptrend line and has maid a lower low, all that is needed to confirm the uptrend is over is a lower high. But months before the price broke below the uptrend line, the MACD momentum indicator was showing bearish divergence between it and the price. In early September 2014 the price made a higher high but the MACD made a lower high. This is called a bearish divergence and is an early warning signal that the momentum in the uptrend is weakening and the trend could be reversing soon. Notice I said could and not would. In this situation I would reduce my trailing stop to 10% and keep a watchful eye on this stock over the coming months. There are many other indicators that could be used as signals or as early warnings, but I thought I would talk about some of my favourites and ones I use on a daily and weekly basis. If you were to employ any of these techniques into your investing or trading it may take a little while to learn about them properly and to implement them into your trading plan, but once you have done that you would only need to spend 1 to 2 hours per week managing your portfolio if trading long-term or about 1 hour per nigh (after market close) if trading more medium term.", "com_question": "How do Moving Average and Rate Of Change compare for long-term market timing in terms of effectiveness? Which technique is more reliable for predicting market trends over a 5-year period?", "com_reference": "The Moving Average (MA) and Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator are both useful tools for long-term market timing, but they serve different purposes and have different strengths.\n\nThe MA is a trend-following indicator that helps smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. It is commonly used to identify the direction of the trend and potential reversal points. A longer period MA, such as a 100-week MA, is often employed for long-term analysis to reduce false signals and whipsaws. By selling when the price closes below the MA, it aims to capture significant movements in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the ROC Indicator is a momentum oscillator that compares the current price to a price in the past to measure the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential trend changes. By buying when the ROC crosses above zero and selling when it crosses below zero, it aims to catch changes in market momentum.\n\nIn terms of predicting market trends over a 5-year period, the Moving Average can be considered more reliable for long-term market timing. The MA gives a clear indication of the overall trend direction and tends to be more stable over extended periods, making it effective for capturing major trends in the market. The ROC Indicator, while useful for detecting momentum shifts and shorter-term fluctuations, may generate more signals and false alarms over a longer timeframe.\n\nWhen used together as suggested in the passage, the MA can serve as an early warning system for trend reversals, while the ROC Indicator can help confirm momentum shifts. Combining these two techniques can provide a comprehensive approach to long-term market timing by capturing both the direction of the trend and changes in momentum."}

In broad terms, the balances of your accounts and your future benefit won't change. It's only the source of these benefits that's changing. The Bloomberg article describes the changes this way: The state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of Sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state-run social security system... The state will assume control of 51.5 percent of pension-fund assets, including bonds guaranteed by the government and “other non-stock assets” After the change, Polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state-run pension system. The balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits shouldn't change, but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements. The effect this change will have on future benefits isn't clear, because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt, not solve it. The government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds, less money went into the government's fund, which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities.  The government's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt, but in exchange, the government is increasing its future pension liabilities. Years down the road, the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they're taking on today. In other words, they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road, and it's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time.", "com_question": "In contrast to private pension funds, how does the state-run social security system differ in managing retirement benefits? Which system ensures greater stability in pension liabilities over the long term?", "com_reference": "In contrast to private pension funds, the state-run social security system differs in that it is managed and controlled by the government. The state-run social security system typically provides a guaranteed level of benefits to all eligible individuals based on a set of rules and regulations established by the government. The government has the authority to make changes to the system, such as adjusting benefit levels or contribution rates, in response to economic or demographic changes.\n\nOn the other hand, private pension funds are typically managed by financial institutions or private companies. While they may offer the potential for higher returns or more flexibility in investment choices, they also carry greater risk as they are subject to market fluctuations and investment performance.\n\nIn terms of ensuring greater stability in pension liabilities over the long term, the state-run social security system may be considered more stable because it is backed by the government and has the ability to adjust policies and funding to ensure the sustainability of benefits. Private pension funds, on the other hand, may be more vulnerable to economic risks and market uncertainties, which could impact the stability of pension liabilities over time."}

Which metric is more indicative of a company's intrinsic worth?", "com_reference": "In financial analysis, both enterprise value and equity value are important metrics used to determine a company's overall value, but they serve different purposes.\n\nEnterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company's total value, taking into account its debt, equity, cash, and other liquid assets. It provides a more comprehensive view of a company's worth compared to equity value. EV is calculated by adding a company's market capitalization, debt, minority interest, and preferred shares, then subtracting cash and cash equivalents.\n\nEquity value, on the other hand, represents the value of a company's shareholders' equity or ownership stake in the business. It is typically calculated by multiplying the company's share price by the number of shares outstanding.\n\nWhen comparing and contrasting enterprise value and equity value, it's essential to understand that enterprise value takes into account a company's debt and cash holdings, providing a more accurate reflection of its total value. Equity value, on the other hand, focuses solely on the value attributable to shareholders.\n\nIn terms of a company's intrinsic worth, some analysts argue that enterprise value is a more indicative measure because it considers the total capital structure, including debt and cash. Others believe that equity value is a more straightforward measure of a company's worth to its shareholders.\n\nUltimately, the choice between using enterprise value or equity value depends on the specific context and the nature of the analysis being conducted. Both metrics offer valuable insights into a company's financial health and performance, and it's essential to consider them in conjunction with other financial metrics to make a well-rounded evaluation of a company's worth."}

This is real money that get's credited in to people's bank accounts to purchase real goods and services. Now who purchases the majority of treasuries? The Primary Dealers. What are the Primary Dealers? They are banks. Where do banks get their money? From us.  So now put two and two together.

Which entities mainly purchase government securities and what implications does this have on the economy?", "com_reference": "In the given passage, the argument presented about government spending and bond market mechanics may not be entirely accurate. While it is true that the government can create money through mechanisms such as printing currency or digital currency, it typically does not directly print money to fund its deficit spending. Instead, the government borrows money by issuing treasury securities, which are then purchased by a variety of entities including individuals, financial institutions, and foreign governments.\n\nThe bond market plays a crucial role in controlling the money supply by influencing interest rates. When the government issues more securities to fund its spending, it increases the supply of bonds in the market. As a result, the increased demand for these bonds can drive up interest rates, which can have various effects on the economy.\n\nThe primary dealers, which are typically large financial institutions, are key players in the bond market as they are authorized to trade directly with the Federal Reserve. These primary dealers often purchase a significant portion of government securities, but they are not the sole purchasers. Other investors, including pension funds, foreign governments, and individual investors, also buy government securities.\n\nThe implications of these dynamics on the economy can be complex. For example, increased government spending and borrowing can lead to higher levels of debt, which may impact interest rates, inflation, and overall economic stability. Additionally, the flow of funds from selling government securities can have various effects on financial markets and global trade.\n\nOverall, it is important to consider multiple factors and perspectives when evaluating how government spending, bond market mechanics, and the entities purchasing government securities interact and impact the economy."}

If you have a loan with 80% interest, yes, get that paid off as quickly as possible. Much better to be paying even the outrageous 20% on a credit card than the astounding 80%. As others have noted, if you can get a consolidation loan or refinance that 80% to something more realistic, do it and do it as soon as possible. Heck, if you have the credit limit, use the credit card to off the 80% loan. 20% on a credit card is better than 80%. Of course you may not have enough credit limit to do that. Cash-back rewards are nice if you are paying off the credit card balance each month. But in your case, you're not. 25% with a 2% cash back reward means you're still paying 23% the first month and 25% every month after that. That's worse than 20%. Remember you pay the interest on your balance every month that you don't pay it off, while a cash-back is a one-time thing. So if you're not going to pay off the balance, AT BEST a cash back reward could be effectively subtracted from the interest rate. 20% with a 2% cashback is effectively somewhere between 18% and 20%. If you're comparing 20% with 2% cashback to 19%, could be complicated to figure out which is better. But it's clearly worse than anything more than 20%. Besides that, you don't say what your total debt is in relation to your income. If you have a lot of debt, I'd say first thing is to figure out what you can do to cut your expenses. Lots of things that people call \"\"fixed expenses\"\" aren't really fixed at all, they just take some effort to cut. Like if you have a big expensive house and you're paying a large mortgage, you can (probably) cut that by selling the place and moving to a cheaper house.

If you have large heating bills, you can turn the thermostat down and get used to wearing a sweater around the house. Etc.

And I intend to ... right after I buy this one last thing that I really really want.\"\" But of course after that there's one more vital purchase, and then another, etc. Avoid falling into this trap.\"", "com_question": "Compared with a credit card at 20% interest, how do cash-back rewards impact effective interest rates?

This means that the cash-back rewards effectively reduce the interest rate by the percentage earned back. However, it is highlighted that this is only beneficial if you pay off the credit card balance each month. If you are not paying off the balance, the cash-back rewards may not significantly impact the overall interest you are paying on the debt.\n\nIn terms of reducing debt quickly, paying down a credit card at 20% interest without relying on cash-back rewards may be more straightforward and effective. It is suggested that focusing on cutting expenses, such as fixed costs that can be reduced or eliminated, is crucial in improving your financial situation and paying off debt faster.\n\nUltimately, it is important to carefully consider your financial circumstances and spending habits to determine the most effective strategy for reducing debt quickly and efficiently."}

Time is an important part of the order matching process. Orders are not processed in parallel; otherwise, the problem of fairness, already heavily regulated, would become even more complex. First, crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators.  Crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another's ask, or a lower ask than another's bid.  A locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another.  HFTs would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees. Since these are forbidden, and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur, orders are serialized (queued up), processed in order of price-time priority. So, the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order. Regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair.

This can impact the efficiency and speed at which orders are executed.\n\nThe market situation that best aligns with regulatory fairness guidelines is one where orders are processed in a serialized manner, following price-time priority. This means that orders are queued up and processed in the order they were received, based on their price and timestamp.

This indicates that the consumption patterns of the wealthy differ from those of the general population, as the general population's consumption is likely more evenly distributed across various income levels.\n\nIn terms of addressing wealth inequality, there are several societal measures that can be effective. These may include:\n\n1. Progressive taxation: Implementing a tax system where those with higher incomes or wealth pay a higher percentage of taxes can help redistribute resources more equitably.\n\n2. Investing in education and workforce development: Providing access to quality education and training programs can help create more opportunities for social mobility and reduce income disparities.\n\n3. Strengthening social safety nets: Implementing and expanding social welfare programs such as unemployment benefits, healthcare, and housing assistance can help support those who are most vulnerable in society.\n\n4. Promoting fair wages and workers' rights: Ensuring that workers are paid fairly and have access to benefits and protections can help reduce income inequality and improve overall economic well-being.\n\nBy combining these and other measures, policymakers can work towards creating a more equitable society and addressing wealth inequality."}

Overall financial planning efficiency can be impacted as well, as managing the tax implications and fluctuations in stock prices can require more effort and record-keeping.\n\nIn terms of simplicity and maximum financial benefit in the US, conventional salary would generally provide the least complexity as it is typically easier to understand and manage from a tax perspective. Conventional salary payments are usually subject to withholding taxes and are taxed as ordinary income, making it a more straightforward compensation method.\n\nHowever, receiving discounted company stock can also offer financial benefits, such as potential for capital gains if the stock price appreciates. This can provide additional financial incentives beyond just a regular salary.\n\nUltimately, the choice between receiving discounted company stock or conventional salary would depend on individual preferences, tax planning strategies, risk tolerance, and overall financial goals.

This strategy allows for tax-free growth on contributions and earnings, provided that the account is held for at least five years and withdrawal requirements are met.\n\nIn terms of withdrawal flexibility, the Mega Backdoor Roth IRA may offer more options for penalty-free withdrawals compared to traditional 401K conversions. The Mega Backdoor Roth IRA also provides tax-free withdrawals on contributions and earnings under certain conditions.\n\nIn general, the Mega Backdoor Roth IRA can offer better long-term benefits for retirement savings due to the tax-free growth potential and flexibility in withdrawals.

{"ID": "fiqa_593", "context": "\"For one thing fund managers, even fund management companies, own less money than their clients put together. On the whole they simply cannot underwrite 50% of the potential losses of the funds they manage, and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured. Warren Buffet owns about 1/3 of Berkshire Hathaway, so I suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to, and I won't guess why he prefers his own business model (investing in the fund he manages, or used to manage) over the one you propose for him (keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on B-H). Buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see B-H do well, and it's not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive. You say that the details are immaterial. Supposing instead of 50% it was 0.0001%, one part in a million. Then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this: \"\"invest 50 million, lose it all, and I'll buy dinner to apologise\"\". But would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50%? Then the details are material. Actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money, putting 50% into the fund and 50% into a cash account. If you make money on the fund, you only make half as much as if you'd been fully invested, so half your profit has been \"\"taken\"\" when you get back the fund value + cash. If you lose money on the fund, pay you back 50% of your losses using the cash. Worst case scenario[*], the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50% of your initial investment. The combined fund+cash investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit. The manager has offered the terms you asked for (-50% leverage) but still doesn't have skin the game. Your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect. Why don't fund managers offer this? Because with a few exceptions 50% is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash, and nobody would buy it. If you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank, open an account, and keep the interest for yourself. You don't expect your managed fund to do it. Furthermore, supposing the manager did invest 100% of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital, that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the fund's wins/losses. You've given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own: they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money. They're better off without you since there's less paperwork, and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them. If you think they can make better picks than you, and you want them to do so on your behalf, then you need to pay them for the privilege. Riding their coattails for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you. It turns out that you cannot force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio. Otherwise they can find ways to insure/hedge the risk they're required to take on. If it's on their books but cancelled by something else then they aren't really exposed. So to provide incentive what we normally want is what Buffett does, which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen, and to draw a salary in return for letting you in[**]. Their investment cannot precisely match yours because the fund manager's capital doesn't precisely match your capital. It doesn't cover your losses because it's in the same fund, so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with. But it does provide the incentive. [*] All right, I admit it, worst case scenario there's a total banking collapse, end of civilization as we know it, and the cash account defaults. But then even in your proposed scheme it's possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to materialise. [**] So why, you might ask, do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being part-paid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise? I honestly don't know, but I suspect \"\"lots of reasons\"\". Probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management. Probably the benefit to the fund itself, which wants to attract more clients, of beating certain benchmarks. Probably other things including, frankly, human error in setting their compensation packages.\"", "com_question": "How does the proposed scheme differ compared with Warren Buffet's investment model? Which approach provides the necessary incentive for fund managers?", "com_reference": "The proposed scheme differs from Warren Buffett's investment model in the sense that it suggests fund managers underwrite a certain percentage of potential losses with their own capital. This approach aims to incentivize fund managers by aligning their interests more closely with those of their clients. However, the passage argues that this proposed scheme may not provide sufficient motivation for fund managers to make optimal investment decisions and take on appropriate risks.\n\nOn the other hand, Warren Buffett's investment model involves him personally owning a significant portion of Berkshire Hathaway, thereby directly linking his financial success to the performance of the company. This strong alignment of interests incentivizes Buffett to make sound investment decisions that benefit both himself and his shareholders.\n\nUltimately, the passage suggests that the most effective way to incentivize fund managers is through a combination of having them personally invested in the fund they manage, receiving a salary for their services, and offering performance-based bonuses tied to specific targets. This multi-faceted approach ensures that fund managers have a personal stake in the fund's performance while also being compensated for their efforts."}

Fiat currency can be created by the government without the need for a corresponding amount of gold reserves. In terms of redemption, fiat currency can be exchanged for goods and services, and its value is determined by supply and demand in the market.\n\nRegarding the stability of economies, both the gold standard and fiat currency systems have their pros and cons. The gold standard provided a fixed value for the currency based on the gold reserves held by the central bank, which could help prevent inflation but could also limit the flexibility of the economy. On the other hand, the fiat currency system allows for more flexibility in monetary policy, enabling central banks to respond to economic conditions more effectively. However, it can also be more susceptible to inflation and loss of value if not managed properly.\n\nUltimately, the stability of an economy depends on various factors beyond the choice of monetary system, including government policies, economic conditions, and global economic trends.

{"ID": "fiqa_616", "context": "\"The market capitalization of a stock is the number of shares outstanding (of each stock class), times the price of last trade (of each stock class). In a liquid market (where there are lots of buyers and sellers at all price points), this represents the price that is between what people are bidding for the stock and what people are asking for the stock.  If you offer any small amount more than the last price, there will be a seller, and if you ask any small amount less than the last price, there will be a buyer, at least for a small amount of stock. Thus, in a liquid market, everyone who owns the stock doesn't want to sell at least some of their stock for a bit less than the last trade price, and everyone who doesn't have the stock doesn't want to buy some of the stock for a bit more than the last trade price. With those assumptions, and a low-friction trading environment, we can say that the last trade value is a good midpoint of what people think one share is worth.  If we then multiply it by the number of shares, we get an approximation of what the company is worth. In no way, shape or form does it not mean that there is 32 billion more invested in the company, or even used to purchase stock. There are situations where a 32 billion market cap swing could mean 32 billion more money was invested in the company: the company issues a pile of new shares, and takes in the resulting money.  People are completely neutral about this gathering in of cash in exchange for dilluting shares.  So the share price remains unchanged, the company gains 32 billion dollars, and there are now more shares outstanding.

Unless you consider the investment liquid, and the option to take money out being implicit, it being a continuous action doesn't make much sense. Sometimes the money is invested in the company, when the company causes stocks to come into being and sells them. The owners of stocks has invested money in stocks in that they spent that money to buy the stocks, but the total sum of money ever spent on stocks for a given company is not really a useful value. The market capitalization is an approximation, which under the efficient market hypothesis (that markets find the correct price for things nearly instantly) is reasonably accurate, of the value the company has collectively to its shareholders.  The efficient market hypothesis isn't accurate, but it is an acceptable rule of thumb. Now, this value -- market capitalization -- is arguably not the total value of a company: other stakeholders include bond holders, labour, management, various contract counter-parties, government and customers.  Some companies are structured so that almost all value is captured not by the stock owners, but by contract counter-parties (this is sometimes used for hiding assets or debts).

The US has traditionally been a powerhouse in technology, especially in computer science, with widely-used platforms such as Facebook and Google. However, China has been rapidly developing its own tech ecosystem and is becoming increasingly competitive, as seen in the development of homegrown tech platforms.\n\nRegarding which country is expected to dominate the future market, it is important to note that both the US and China are likely to play key roles. The US has a strong foundation in technology and innovation, while China has a massive market and is rapidly advancing in technological capabilities.

{"ID": "fiqa_622", "context": "If you have multiple accounts, you have to empty them all before you can deduct any losses. Your loss is not a capital loss, its a deduction. It is calculated based on the total amount you have withdrawn from all your Roth IRA's, minus the total basis. It will be subject to the 2% AGI treshhold (i.e.: if your AGI is > 100K, none of it is deductible, and you have to itemize to get it). Bottom line - think twice. Summarizing the discussion in comments: If you have a very low AGI, I would guess that your tax liability is pretty low as well. Even if you deduct the whole $2K, and all of it is above the other deductions you have (which in turn is above the standard deduction of almost $6K), you save say $300 if you're in 15% tax bracket. That's the most savings you have. However I'm assuming something here: I'm assuming that you're itemizing your deductions already and they're above the standard deduction. This is very unlikely, with such a low income. You don't have state taxes to deduct, you probably don't spend a lot to deduct sales taxes, and I would argue that with the low AGI you probably don't own property, and if you do - you don't have a mortgage with a significant interest on it. You can be in 15% bracket with AGI between (roughly) $8K and $35K, i.e.: you cannot deduct between $160 and $750 of the $2K, so it's already less than the maximum $300. If your AGI is $8K, the deduction doesn't matter, EIC might cover all of your taxes anyway. If your AGI is $30K, you can deduct only $1400, so if you're in the 15% bracket - you saved $210. That, again, assuming it's above your other deductions, which in turn are already above the standard deduction. Highly unlikely.

Which loss deduction strategy is more advantageous for individuals with lower AGI levels?", "com_reference": "The passage discusses the deduction of losses from Roth IRAs and compares it to the deduction of capital losses for tax purposes. Here is a summary to answer your question:\n\n1. Tax Benefits: Roth IRA losses are treated as deductions, not capital losses. These deductions are subject to the 2% AGI threshold and may not be deductible if your AGI is over $100,000. Capital losses, on the other hand, are deductions against capital gains and can offset other income, with certain limitations.\n\n2. Eligibility Criteria: Roth IRA deductions are based on the total amount withdrawn from all your Roth IRAs minus the total basis. Capital loss deductions are based on the amount of capital losses incurred during a tax year.\n\n3. Advantage for Lower AGI Levels: For individuals with lower AGI levels, the Roth IRA deductions may be more advantageous. This is because the tax savings from Roth IRA deductions are limited by the 2% AGI threshold and other deductions, making it less likely for individuals with lower AGI levels to fully benefit from them. On the other hand, capital losses can be used to offset other income or gains, providing more direct tax benefits for individuals with lower AGI levels.\n\nIn conclusion, individuals with lower AGI levels may find capital loss deductions more advantageous for directly reducing their taxable income, compared to Roth IRA deductions which are subject to limitations and thresholds."}

Debt investment: When you lend money to a company through a loan, you become a creditor, and the company is obligated to repay the loan amount along with interest as per the terms of the loan agreement. Unlike equity holders, creditors have a financial obligation from the company to repay the loan amount on a specified timeline.\n\nIn terms of aligning with investment goals and tax strategy, it depends on individual preferences and risk tolerance:\n\n- Equity investment may be suitable for investors seeking potential capital appreciation and dividends from the company's performance. However, it involves higher risk compared to debt investment as the returns are variable and contingent on the company's success.\n\n- Debt investment may be more suitable for investors looking for fixed returns and lower risk, as they receive repayment of the loan amount along with interest regardless of the company's performance. Debt investments can provide a steady income stream but may have lower potential returns compared to equity investments.\n\nRegarding tax implications, both equity and debt investments have different tax treatments based on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. It is advisable to consult with a tax professional to understand the tax implications of each investment type and determine the most effective way to repatriate money from your investment based on your financial goals and tax strategy."}

You can blame walmart for trying to make as much as possible and not caring about their workforce.  Look at costco and how they start all employees off at 12 dollars an hour.  The company does amazing still.  Also there have been countless studies that show increasing minimum wage does not hurt local businesses but actually helps out the economy.

While Costco's practice of starting employees at $12 an hour demonstrates a commitment to fair wages, a $15 minimum wage would further increase the standard of living for low-wage workers across various industries. \n\nA $15 minimum wage would likely have a greater impact on lifting individuals out of poverty and reducing reliance on government assistance, thereby providing a boost to the economy. Additionally, studies have shown that increasing the minimum wage can lead to higher purchasing power for lower and middle-class individuals, as well as potentially stimulate the growth of small businesses. \n\nIn terms of economic benefits, the $15 minimum wage may have a more significant overall positive impact compared to starting employees at $12, as it sets a higher standard for worker compensation across the board and can lead to broader economic growth."}

Here's how the longevity of games, cost comparison, and market demand differ between the two subscription services:\n\n1. Longevity of Games: Games tend to have a longer lifespan compared to movies as people spend more time playing games than watching movies. This difference in engagement levels affects the turnover rate of game titles on a subscription platform like GameFly compared to Netflix.\n\n2. Cost Comparison: The passage mentions that game prices have actually gone up over the last ten years, whereas movie prices have not seen the same increase. This cost difference reflects how consumers value games versus movies and influences their willingness to pay for a subscription service.\n\n3. Market Demand: The passage notes that people are still willing to pay $60 for premium newly released games, indicating a strong demand for the traditional game purchasing model. This contrasts with the subscription-based model offered by GameFly and Netflix, where consumers pay a regular fee for access to a library of games or movies.\n\nConsidering the differences in longevity, cost comparison, and market demand, it appears that the subscription model offered by Netflix aligns better with the media industry's evolution. The consumption of movies and TV shows lends itself well to a subscription-based, on-demand streaming service, as seen with the success of Netflix. On the other hand, the gaming industry has not fully embraced a similar subscription model due to factors such as game longevity, pricing trends, and consumer preferences for owning premium game titles."}

Which approach better serves the public's interests?", "com_reference": "In the given passage, the author suggests two possible approaches to address the issue of emergency preparation within the airline industry. The first is for the government to arrange to reimburse the airlines for emergency prep expenses, while the second proposes making emergency preparation a duty that comes with airway access.\n\nWhen comparing these two approaches, there are key considerations to evaluate. Government reimbursement would involve the government compensating airlines for their emergency preparation expenses, likely through funding or subsidies. This approach may provide immediate financial relief to the airlines and incentivize them to invest in emergency preparation. However, the effectiveness of this approach would depend on the government's ability to allocate sufficient funds and oversee how the funds are being used.\n\nOn the other hand, making emergency preparation a duty that comes with airway access would entail mandating airlines to prioritize and invest in emergency preparedness as a requirement for operating in the airspace. This approach would place the responsibility on the airlines to ensure they are adequately prepared for emergencies, potentially leading to more proactive and comprehensive emergency planning. However, enforcing such a duty would require regulatory mechanisms and oversight to ensure compliance, which could pose challenges in implementation and enforcement.\n\nIn terms of serving the public's interests, both approaches have their merits and potential drawbacks. Government reimbursement could provide financial support to airlines and encourage investment in emergency preparedness, potentially enhancing overall safety and security for passengers. On the other hand, making emergency preparation a duty could establish a baseline requirement for all airlines, promoting consistent and standardized emergency preparedness practices across the industry.\n\nUltimately, the effectiveness of either approach in serving the public's interests would depend on various factors, including the level of oversight, accountability, and enforcement mechanisms put in place. A comprehensive analysis considering cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and the impact on safety and security would be necessary to determine which approach better serves the public's interests in enhancing emergency preparedness within the airline industry."}

It points to the influence of money and questions the motives behind decisions such as starting wars and leading to overcrowded prisons.\n\nCompared with incompetence, the state structure can have a significant impact on spending in several ways. The structure of the state, including policies, regulations, and established procedures, can influence how money is allocated and utilized. For example, bureaucratic inefficiencies, red tape, and entrenched interests can all contribute to wasteful spending.\n\nDecisions leading to wars and overcrowded prisons are often driven by a complex interplay of factors, including political, economic, and social considerations. The pursuit of power, resources, and influence can play a significant role in the decision-making process. Additionally, historical contexts, security concerns, and foreign policy objectives can also influence the initiation of wars.\n\nRegarding overcrowded prisons, factors such as mandatory sentencing laws, lack of rehabilitative programs, profit motives of private prisons, and societal attitudes towards crime and punishment can all contribute to the issue. Addressing these issues requires a holistic approach that considers systemic flaws and seeks to create more effective and equitable solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, while incompetence can certainly play a role in government spending, the structure of the state and various other factors can also significantly impact how resources are allocated.

Why not, after all? Would you wager a million dollars?  Probably not. The risk is too great. Similarly, day trading can easily lose you all of your investment, which is why you should be careful doing it.

{"ID": "fiqa_663", "context": "A financial institution is not obligated to offer you a loan. They will only offer you a loan if they believe that they will make money off you. They use all the info available in order to determine if offering you a loan is profitable.  In short, whether they offer you a loan, and the interest rate they charge for that loan, is based on a few things: How much does it cost the bank to borrow money? [aka: how much does the bank need to pay people who have savings accounts with them?]; How much does the bank need to spend in order to administer the loan? [ie: the loan officer's time, a little time for the IT guy who helps around the office, office space they are renting in order to allow the transaction to take place]; and How many people will 'default' and never be able to repay their loan? [ex: if 1 out of 100 people default on their loans, then every one of those 100 loans needs to be charged an extra 1% in order to recover the money the bank will lose on the person who defaults]. What we are mostly interested in here is #3: how likely are you to default? The bank determines that by determining your income, your assets, your current debts outstanding, your past history with payments (also called a credit score), and specifically to mortgages, how much the house is worth.  If you don't have a long credit history, and because you don't have a long income history, and because you are putting <10% down on the condo [20% is often a good % to strive for, and paying less than that can often imply you will need mandatory mortgage insurance, depending on jurisdiction] the bank is a little more uncertain about your likelihood to pay.  Banks don't like uncertainty, and they can deal with that uncertainty in two ways: (1) They can charge you a higher interest rate; OR (2) They can refuse you the loan. Now just because one bank refuses you a loan, doesn't mean all will - but being refused by one bank is probably a good indication that many / most institutions would refuse you, because they all use very similar analytical tools to determine your 'risk level'. If you are refused a loan, you can try again at another institution, or you can wait, save a larger down payment, and build your credit history by faithfully paying your credit card every month, paying your utilities, and making your car and rent payments on time. This will give the banks more comfort that you will have the ability to pay your mortgage every month, and a larger down payment will give them comfort that if the housing market dips, you won't owe more than the house is worth. My parting shot is this: If you are new in your career with no income history, be very careful about buying a property immediately, even if you get approved. A good rule of thumb is to only buy a property when you plan on living there for at least 5 years, or else you are likely to lose money overall, after factoring closing costs and maintenance fees. If you are refused a loan, that's probably a good sign that you aren't financially ready yet, but even if a bank approves you for a loan, you might not be ready yet either.", "com_question": "How does a bank determine your loan interest rate compared with the likelihood of default? Which factors influence loan approval risks the most?", "com_reference": "The bank determines your loan interest rate based on the likelihood of default by assessing various factors such as your income, assets, current debts outstanding, credit score, and the value of the property being purchased. Factors that influence loan approval risks the most are income history, credit history, debt levels, down payment amount, and the type of property being financed. The bank aims to evaluate these factors to predict your ability to repay the loan and mitigates risks by either charging a higher interest rate or refusing the loan altogether."}

They often come with lower fees compared to traditional human financial advisors, making them cost-effective. \n- Indexing involves investing in passively managed funds that track a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. Index funds generally have lower fees compared to actively managed mutual funds, making them a cost-effective investment option.\n- Mutual funds can vary in terms of fees, with some funds charging higher fees due to active management, 12b1 fees, or other expenses. While mutual funds can offer active management and potential outperformance, they may come with higher costs compared to robo-advisors and indexing.\n\nIn terms of offering the best balance of low cost and quality financial advice, robo-advisors and indexing are generally considered to be more cost-effective options. They provide automated investment management or passive investment strategies with lower fees compared to actively managed mutual funds. However, the best solution would depend on your individual financial goals, investment preferences, and risk tolerance. It is important to consider factors such as investment objectives, portfolio diversification, and overall cost structure when selecting the most suitable option for your financial needs."}

Fund management positions typically require a deep understanding of investment analysis and portfolio management, which are skills that the CFA program emphasizes and validates. With a CFA certification, candidates demonstrate expertise in areas such as investment research, asset valuation, and risk management, which are highly relevant to fund management roles. Additionally, fund management positions often involve more complex and strategic decision-making responsibilities, which the rigorous CFA curriculum prepares candidates for.\n\nIn terms of career advancement and financial reward, pursuing a fund management role with a CFA certification generally offers greater potential compared to roles at large broker-dealers. Fund managers typically have more autonomy and higher levels of responsibility in managing investment portfolios, which can lead to greater career progression opportunities and potentially higher financial rewards based on the performance of the funds they manage. On the other hand, roles at large broker-dealers may offer stability and a steady income, but may have limited opportunities for career advancement and financial growth compared to fund management positions.\n\nOverall, obtaining a CFA certification and pursuing a career in fund management can be a challenging but rewarding path that offers greater potential for career advancement and financial reward in the finance industry."}

The author suggests that while government projects may be frustratingly slow and inefficient from an outside perspective, they involve significant planning and preparation for various eventualities. On the other hand, private corporations may prioritize economic stimulation over quality and safety, potentially leading to issues in the long term.\n\nIn terms of long-term planning and public benefit, government-led infrastructure projects are often better positioned to ensure sustainable development. This is because governments are accountable to the public and have a mandate to prioritize the long-term well-being of society over short-term economic gains. Government projects typically involve extensive planning, consider public needs, and aim to address future challenges, even if this might result in slower delivery.\n\nOn the other hand, privately managed projects may focus more on short-term profits and efficiency, potentially sacrificing long-term sustainability and public benefit. Private corporations may cut corners on quality and safety to reduce costs and increase profitability, which can lead to future problems and higher costs for society to rectify.\n\nTherefore, in the context of today's infrastructure projects, a government-led approach is generally more conducive to ensuring sustainable development.

However, my best guess (given that the duration is stated without units) is that this is a modified duration. This is defined as the percentage decrease in the bond price for a 1% increase in the yield. So, change in price = -price x duration (as %) x change in yield (in %) For your duration of 5, this means that the bond price decreases by a relative 5% for every 1% absolute increase in its yield. Using the actual yield change in your question, 0.18%, we find: change in price = -1015 x 5% x (4.87 - 4.69) = -9.135 So the new price will be 1015 - 9.135 = £1005.865", "com_question": "How does the modified duration impact bond prices compared with other duration measures?

This metric helps investors understand how sensitive a bond's price is to changes in interest rates. In this case, with a duration of 5, the bond price is expected to decrease by 5% for every 1% increase in its yield.\n\nModified duration is just one way to measure price sensitivity to changes in yield. Other common duration measures include Macaulay duration, effective duration, and convexity. Each duration metric has its own nuances and uses in bond valuation and risk management.\n\nTo determine which duration metric provides the most accurate price sensitivity estimation, it is essential to consider the specific characteristics of the bond, the yield curve environment, and the investment horizon. Generally, modified duration is a good metric for estimating short-term price changes when interest rates fluctuate modestly. However, for complex bond structures or significant interest rate shifts, other duration measures such as effective duration or convexity may offer more precise estimations of price sensitivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice of duration metric depends on the specific bond and market conditions. Investors should consider multiple duration measures and evaluate their strengths and limitations to make informed decisions about bond price sensitivity."}

A private market system for police services typically means that security and dispute resolution are provided by private businesses operating in a competitive market.\n\nThe comparison between a private market police system and a government-led law enforcement system is a complex and debated topic. Advocates of private market systems argue that competition among service providers could lead to better quality services, innovation, and efficiency. Proponents suggest that private entities would be more accountable to their customers in terms of providing effective and satisfactory solutions to crime and disputes.\n\nOn the other hand, critics raise concerns about the potential for inequality in access to justice, corruption, lack of oversight, and conflicts of interest in a private market system. Government-led law enforcement, while not without its own challenges, is often seen as more accountable to the public and subject to democratic checks and balances.\n\nUltimately, the efficacy of each approach in ensuring public safety and accountability may vary depending on the specific context and implementation. It is essential to consider various factors, including regulation, oversight, transparency, and the protection of individual rights when evaluating the merits of different policing systems."}

{"ID": "fiqa_695", "context": "The standard goal of valuing anything is to seek the fair price for that thing in the open market. Depending on what is being valued, that may or may not be an easy task. eg: to value your home, get a real estate appraiser, who will look at recent market sales in your area, and adjust for nuances of your property. To value your loan guarantee, you would need to figure out what it is actually worth to the business, which may be difficult. In a perfect world, you would be able to ask the bank to tell you the interest rate you would have to pay, if the loan was not guaranteed. This would show you the value you are providing to the business by guaranteeing it. ie: if the interest would be $100k a year unguaranteed, but is only $40k a year guaranteed, you are saving the business $60k a year. If the loan is to last 5 years, that's a total of $300k. Of course, it is likely the bank simply won't offer you an unguaranteed loan at all. This makes the value quite difficult to determine, and highlights the underlying transaction you are considering:  You are taking on personal risk of loan default, to profit the business. If you truly can't find an equitable way to value the guarantee, consider whether you understand the true risk of what you are doing. If you are able to determine an appropriate value for the loan, consider whether increasing your equity is fair compensation. There are other methods of compensation available, such as having the company pay you directly, or decrease the amount of capital you need to invest for this new set of equity.  In the end, what is fair is what the other shareholders agree to. If you go to the shareholders with anything less than professional 3rd party advice (and stackexchange does not count as professional), then they may be wary of accepting your 'fee', no matter how reasonable.", "com_question": "What are the key challenges in valuing a loan guarantee compared with valuing a property? How can one ensure fairness and transparency in determining the value of such guarantees?", "com_reference": "The key challenges in valuing a loan guarantee compared with valuing a property include the subjective nature of determining the value of the guarantee, as well as the lack of readily available market data to rely on. When valuing a property, real estate appraisers have recent sales data and other comparable properties to reference, making the process more standardized. On the other hand, valuing a loan guarantee involves assessing the potential risk of loan default and the savings it provides to the business, which can be more complex and less concrete.\n\nTo ensure fairness and transparency in determining the value of such guarantees, one can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Seek professional advice: Consulting with experts such as financial advisors or valuation experts can provide an unbiased and objective assessment of the value of the loan guarantee.\n\n2. Use objective measures: Utilize financial models and calculators to quantify the potential savings or benefits the guarantee provides to the business. This can help in determining a more accurate value.\n\n3. Consider market conditions: Take into account the current market conditions and industry trends when assessing the value of the guarantee. This can provide context and help in making a more informed decision.\n\n4. Communicate openly: Have transparent discussions with all relevant stakeholders, including other shareholders, about the methodology and reasoning behind the valuation of the loan guarantee. This can help build trust and agreement on the determined value.\n\nBy following these steps and approaching the valuation process with diligence and transparency, one can work towards ensuring fairness in determining the value of loan guarantees."}

{"ID": "fiqa_699", "context": "\"All else being equal, you should look for more volatile (riskier) stocks. Technically, it was all time value - the entire value of an \"\"out of the money\"\" option is time value.   What's confusing is that time value is affected by numerous variables, only one of which is time. The reason volatility is the one to look at is that all the rest are likely already intuitive to you, or are too minor an influence to worry about: Current risk-free interest rates and a stock's dividend payout during the life of the option affect the value of the call, but are usually minor infulences.   (Higher interest rates makes call values higher, and higher dividend yield makes call values lower.) Longer time to expiration will increase the value of the call, but you're pretty likely already focused on that. The strike price's proximity to the current price affects the call's value - agreeing to sell a stock 5% above current levels will pay more than agreeing to sell it 10% above current levels - but again, this is likely obvious to you. Volatility, or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day, is almost certainly the variable that's not already obvious. Stocks that jump all over the place have higher volatility than those that move more predictably.     The reason that options (calls and puts) cost more on higher volatility names is that options' payout is asymmetrical.  In the case of calls, the option holder gets all the upside, but none of the downside, other than what they paid for the opotion.     If one stock goes up or down $5 every day, and another goes up or down $20 every day and you could pay some fixed amount to get that stock's upside, but not have any exposure to its downside, other than that fixed amount, you'd pay more for the one that pays you $20 or $0 than you would for the one that pays you $5 or $0.    That's why higher volatility (meaning larger daily moves) makes optimum prices higher.\"", "com_question": "How does volatility compared to other factors affect options pricing? Which factor plays a crucial role in determining optimal prices?", "com_reference": "Volatility compared to other factors has a significant impact on options pricing. While factors like interest rates, dividend yield, time to expiration, and strike price proximity all play a role in determining the value of an option, volatility is often considered the most crucial factor in determining optimal prices. \n\nThis is because volatility, or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day, influences the potential price movements of the stock. Higher volatility means greater potential price swings, which can result in larger potential gains for option holders. \n\nIn the context of options trading, higher volatility leads to higher option prices because options' payout is asymmetrical. This asymmetry allows option holders to benefit from the upside potential of a stock without having to bear the downside risk beyond the initial investment in the option. Therefore, stocks with higher volatility tend to have higher options prices to account for the increased potential for significant price movements."}

First, you want to invest money, and presumably you're not looking at the \"\"lowest risk, lowest returns\"\" end of the spectrum. This is an inherently risky activity.  Second, you are in a principal-agent relationship with your advisor, and are exposed to the risk of your advisor not maximizing your profits. A lot has been written on principal-agent theory, and while incentive schemes exist, there is no optimal solution.  In your case, you hope that your agent will start maximizing your profits if they are 100% correlated with his profits. While this idea is true (at least according to standard economic theory, you could find exceptions in behavioral economics and in reality), it also forces the agent to participate in the first risk.  From the point of view of the agent, this does not make sense. He is looking to render services and receive income for it. An agent with integrity is certainly prepared to carry the risk of his own incompetence, just like Apple is prepared to replace your iPhone should it not start one day. But the agent is not prepared to carry additional risks such as the market risk, and should not be compelled to do so. It is your risk, a risk you personally take by deciding to play the investment gamble, and you cannot transfer it to somebody else.  Of course, what makes the situation here more difficult than the iPhone example is that market-driven losses cannot be easily distinguished from incompetent-agent losses. So, there is no setup in which you carry the market risk only and your agent carries the incompetence risk only. But as much as you want a solution in which the agent carries all risk, you probably won't find an agent willing to sign such a contract. So you have to simply accept that both the market risk and the incompetence risk are inherent to being an investor.

{"ID": "fiqa_714", "context": "One factor to consider is that some employers have a 401k contribution match policy that only allows a certain percentage of any given paycheck to be matched. So if the company is willing to match 4% of each paycheck, you could run into a problem here where you lose out on some of your company match. For example, suppose you get a $20,000 bonus. You can contribute $18,000 per year to your 401k and this bonus could be a nice way to knock most of that out and then take home your full paycheck the rest of the year. Sounds pretty nice, but there's a problem. The company will only match 4% of your $20,000 ($800) when they otherwise would have matched up to 4% of your annual salary ($4,000 if you're making $100,000 in this example). I'd say it's definitely worth it to make a big contribution to your 401k when you get a bonus as it's an easy way to get a lot of money in there without really feeling a loss (since it's extra money on top of your normal paycheck).

Bonds have predetermined repayment schedules and fixed interest rates, providing more clarity and predictability for both the borrower and the lender. On the other hand, debt credit facilities can have variable interest rates and repayment structures, which may introduce more uncertainty and potentially higher financial risk."}

{"ID": "fiqa_718", "context": "\"I don't know Canada very well, but can offer some general points when considering where to park your emergency fund. Savings rates are currently low, but then so is inflation. Always bear in mind that inflation decreases the value of your money, so if you're getting 4% interest and inflation is 2%, you're making 2% gross in real terms. If you're getting 2% and inflation is close to zero, you're actually earning a similar amount, it's just the numbers are going up more slowly. Obviously when and how much tax you pay affects the actual return, it's just worth bearing in mind that low interest and low inflation are actually not that bad a savings environment as they first appear. For an emergency fund the key thing is ease of access, consider keeping some portion of your savings in an instant access account for those emergencies that happen when the banks are closed. In the UK there are various tax-free savings options, I'm guessing Canada has a few too, if so you should explore those options. While these may not have attractive headline rates, you don't pay tax on the interest, this can make them much more competitive (4% tax free is the same as 5% gross if you would have to pay tax at 20%). Normally tax free investments have caps so once you've invested a set amount you can't add anymore. This may be a consideration if you regularly dip into your emergency fund as you might not easily be able to build it up again. My approach is to have about 90% of my \"\"rainy day\"\" fund in easily accessible but tax free savings. This discourages me from spending it unless I really need to. I then keep a slush fund sufficient to cover every day disasters (boiler packing up, needing a hire car for a week etc) in instant access accounts .\"", "com_question": "How does the tax treatment of savings impact the real return compared with headline rates? What allocation would best balance accessibility and tax benefits for an emergency fund in Canada?", "com_reference": "The tax treatment of savings can significantly impact the real return compared with headline rates. Taxes can erode the value of interest earned on savings, so a tax-free savings option can provide a higher real return than a taxable account with a higher headline rate. For example, earning 4% tax-free is equivalent to earning a higher gross rate in a taxable account, depending on your tax bracket.\n\nIn Canada, a good allocation that balances accessibility and tax benefits for an emergency fund would be to consider keeping a portion of savings in a tax-free savings account (TFSA). TFSAs allow you to earn income tax-free on your investments, providing a valuable tax benefit. Additionally, having some portion of your emergency fund in an instant access account for quick access during emergencies is also important. By allocating a portion to a TFSA and keeping some in an instant access account, you can strike a balance between tax advantages and accessibility for your emergency fund in Canada."}

And put options have a time cost, if you think the market is overvalued and buy lots of puts, but they expire before the market finally corrects, you can lose your entire investment.  Betting on market timing of any kind is extremely difficult to do, some would argue it's impossible. \"\"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent\"\" is a favorite wall street trader saying. Instead of playing a game that's difficult to win, the better option is to play one you can win. That's to learn how to value individual investments well and accumulate cash until you can find investments that are under-valued to invest in. The best way to learn to value investments is to read Graham and Buffett. \"\"The Intelligent Investor\"\" is a good starting point, and you can read all of Buffett's investor letters for the last 30 years + for free on the Berkshire Hathaway web site. Finally the textbook on valuing stocks and other investments is \"\"Securities Analysis\"\" the 6th edition is only version to get, it was updated with Buffett and other leading value investors oversight. A basic overview of valuing investments is that every investment has an \"\"intrinsic value\"\" consisting of it's future cash flows, discounted for the time it takes to receive them. The skill is being able to estimate how likely those cash flows are to happen. a) Is it a good business? Does it have a moat, i.e. barriers that make it hard for competitors to duplicate it? b) Will management invest or distribute those cash flows wisely? Then your strategy is to not even worry about the market, spend your time looking at individual stocks and investments and wait until some come along that's well undervalued. That may be during a market correction, or it may be tomorrow. And it's not just good enough to intelligently value your investments, you also have to have psychological fortitude to not panic and to think for yourself. Buffett describes it best. Ben Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his. Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him. Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you. But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. Lastly learning to value investments isn't just useful in the stock market, they are applicable to investing in any investment such as bonds, real estate, and even buying your home or running a business.\"", "com_question": "In terms of risk management, how does valuing individual investments differ from market timing and which approach is more sustainable?", "com_reference": "Valuing individual investments focuses on assessing the intrinsic value of each investment based on factors like business strength, management quality, and future cash flows. This approach requires a thorough analysis of each investment opportunity and aims to identify undervalued assets that can provide long-term growth potential. By understanding the fundamental value of investments, investors can make informed decisions and hold onto investments with confidence, regardless of short-term market fluctuations.\n\nOn the other hand, market timing involves predicting short-term movements in the overall market and trying to buy or sell assets based on these predictions. This approach is highly speculative and involves a greater degree of uncertainty as it relies on accurately forecasting market trends. Market timing can be challenging and risky, as it often leads to emotional decision-making and can result in losses if the timing of buying and selling is incorrect.\n\nValuing individual investments is considered more sustainable compared to market timing because it focuses on the intrinsic value of assets rather than trying to time the market. By focusing on fundamental analysis and seeking undervalued opportunities, investors can build a diversified portfolio of assets with long-term growth potential. This approach reduces the reliance on short-term market movements and minimizes the impact of volatility on investment decisions, leading to a more stable and sustainable investment strategy."}

This article recommends 50/30/20: According to the popular 50/30/20 rule, you should reserve 50 percent of your budget for essentials like rent and food, 30 percent for discretionary spending, and at least 20 percent for savings. Read more at: https://www.moneyunder30.com/how-much-should-you-save-every-month-2 In the real world, these goals may not be realistic, and different people have different ideas about how aggressive to be with regards to savings. However, you can get a general idea and adapt for your particular needs. Point 3: I find myself looking at my account every single day and get tensed and sad because almost whenever the money (pay) comes in I freak out that after everything there is nothing for us to enjoy or save.", "com_question": "How does the 43% DTI impact flexibility compared to other ratios? Which budget allocation approach best suits varying income levels?", "com_reference": "In the context of debt-to-income ratio (DTI), the 43% guideline is important because it serves as a threshold where lenders start to consider borrowers as having higher risk due to a higher percentage of their income going towards debt payments. Having a DTI below 43% indicates more flexibility in your budget because it shows that you have a larger portion of income available for other expenses after meeting your debt obligations. In comparison, higher DTI ratios mean less flexibility and potentially more financial strain.\n\nWhen it comes to budget allocation approaches, the 50/30/20 rule can be a good guideline for many individuals, as it provides a structured way to divide your income among essentials, discretionary spending, and savings. By allocating 50% of your budget to essentials like rent and food, you ensure that your basic needs are covered. The 30% for discretionary spending allows for some flexibility and enjoyment, while the 20% for savings helps you build a financial cushion for the future.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the 50/30/20 rule may not be perfect for everyone, especially those with varying income levels. It's essential to adapt budgeting strategies to your specific circumstances and priorities. Some individuals may need to adjust the percentages based on their income, expenses, and financial goals to create a budget that works best for them. Flexibility is key when it comes to budgeting, as it allows you to make adjustments as needed to meet your financial needs and aspirations."}

The writer suggests that the problematic aspect of some individuals' views is not about the idea of alternative education approaches, but rather the repeated emphasis on the belief that \"anyone can do it\" and implication that individuals who are not entrepreneurs are lazy. This oversimplification fails to acknowledge the complexities and challenges that individuals from various backgrounds, experiences, and circumstances face in pursuing entrepreneurship.\n\nIn contrast, a more empathetic and community-oriented approach that recognizes the diversity of individual circumstances and challenges would likely resonate better with the community's values. By understanding that entrepreneurship is not one-size-fits-all and that success is influenced by various factors beyond individual effort, such as access to resources, social support, and systemic barriers, a more inclusive and understanding perspective can be developed. Acknowledging and addressing these nuances can lead to more constructive conversations and support within the community."}

However, it also points out that some McKinsey consultants may overdo a good idea to an extreme, implying that there may be unique challenges in applying these principles in certain contexts.\n\nRegarding unutilized cash for a company with durable cash flow, having a substantial amount of cash reserves can be beneficial for equity investors for several reasons:\n1. Liquidity Cushion: Having cash on hand provides a buffer during times of economic uncertainty or market downturns, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations without having to resort to external funding or selling assets at a disadvantageous time.\n2. Flexibility for Investments: Unutilized cash can be used for strategic investments, acquisitions, or research and development initiatives that can enhance the company's competitiveness and drive future growth.\n3. Return of Capital to Shareholders: Companies with excess cash reserves may choose to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks, dividends, or special dividends, increasing shareholder value.\n\nTo optimize value for equity investors, a balanced approach to managing cash reserves is crucial. The company should evaluate its capital structure, investment opportunities, and shareholder expectations to determine the most appropriate financial strategy. This may involve deploying excess cash for value-accretive investments, returning capital to shareholders, or maintaining a prudent cash reserve for future opportunities or contingencies. Ultimately, the financial strategy that aligns with the company's long-term objectives and shareholder interests will likely optimize value over time."}

By having a single policy involved in the claim process, it becomes more difficult for individuals to exploit the system by attempting to claim the same loss multiple times. This approach helps safeguard the rebuilding process after a claim by ensuring that the appropriate amount of funds is allocated for rebuilding efforts, as the insurance company will closely monitor and oversee the disbursement of funds to the re-builder.

Near-the-money options have some intrinsic value but primarily consist of time value. Out-the-money options have no intrinsic value and are composed entirely of time value.\n\nFor investors seeking cost-effective strategies, near-the-money options may be the most advantageous choice. This is because near-the-money options strike a balance between cost and potential profitability.

A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to   any consumer reporting agency if   (i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address   specified by the person for such notices, that specific   information is inaccurate; and   (ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. ... (2) Duty to correct and update information. A person who   (A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information   to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the   person’s transactions or experiences with any consumer; and   (B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information   that the person determines is not complete or accurate, shall   promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination   and provide to the agency any corrections to that information,   or any additional information, that is necessary to make   the information provided by the person to the agency complete   and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any   of the information that remains not complete or accurate.

When a consumer initiates a dispute, the reporting agency is required to investigate the claim and remove the disputed information from the consumer's report if it is found to be inaccurate or cannot be verified. The reporting agency must do this within 30 days if the reporting party does not certify the information is complete and accurate.\n\nIn terms of responsibility for ensuring accurate information, both consumers and reporting agencies have specific duties under the Act. Consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports and the reporting agency is obligated to investigate and correct any errors. The reporting agency holds more responsibility for ensuring accurate information as they are required to promptly stop reporting inaccurate information, investigate disputes, and make necessary corrections. They must also notify the credit agency once they have determined what information is incomplete or inaccurate.

This risk exists because you are spending money to acquire the stock, and if the value of the stock decreases, you may lose the amount you invested. On the other hand, the potential gains from exercising stock options occur when the value of the stock increases above the strike price, allowing you to sell the stock at a profit.\n\nTo maximize profit when exercising stock options, it is important to consider the current market conditions, the future prospects of the company, and your own financial goals. One strategy to potentially maximize profit is to exercise the stock options when you believe the stock price will increase significantly in the future. This would allow you to buy the stock at a lower price (the strike price) and then sell it at a higher price, capturing the difference as profit.\n\nIt is important to note that investing in stock options carries risks, and it is always advisable to consult with a financial advisor or accountant before making any investment decisions."}

{"ID": "fiqa_784", "context": "As others have stated, the current price is simply the last price at which the security traded. For any given tick, however, there are many bid-ask prices because securities can trade on multiple exchanges and between many agents on a single exchange. This is true for both types of exchanges that Chris mentioned in his answer. Chris' answer is pretty thorough in explaining how the two types of exchanges work, so I'll just add some minor details. In exchanges like NASDAQ, there are multiple market makers for most relatively liquid securities, which theoretically introduces competition between them and therefore lowers the bid-ask spreads that traders face. Although this results in the market makers earning less compensation for their risk, they hope to make up the difference by making the market for highly liquid securities. This could also result in your order filling, in pieces, at several different prices if your brokerage firm fills it through multiple market makers. Of course, if you place your order on an exchange where an electronic system fills it (the other type of exchange that Chris mentioned), this could happen anyway.  In short, if you place a market order for 1000 shares, it could be filled at several different prices, depending on volume, multiple bid-ask prices, etc. If you place a sizable order, your broker may fill it in pieces regardless to prevent you from moving the market. This is rarely a problem for small-time investors trading securities with high volumes, but for investors with higher capital like institutional investors, mutual funds, etc. who place large orders relative to the average volume, this could conceivably be a burden, both in the price difference across time as the order is placed and the increased bookkeeping it demands.  This is tangentially related, so I'll add it anyway. In cases like the one described above, all-or-none (AON) orders are one solution; these are orders that instruct the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction. Most brokers offer these, but there are some caveats that apply to them specifically. (I haven't been able to find some of this information, so some of this is from memory).  All-or-none orders are only an option if the order is for more than a certain numbers of shares. I think the minimum size is 300 or 400 shares.  Your order won't be placed until your broker places all other orders ahead of it that don't have special conditions attached to them.  I believe all-or-none orders are day orders, which means that if there wasn't enough supply to fill the order during the day, the order is cancelled at market close.  AON orders only apply to limit orders. If you want to replicate the behavior of a market order with AON characteristics, you can try setting a limit buy/sell order a few cents above/below the current market price.", "com_question": "In contrast to traditional market orders, how do all-or-none orders affect order execution and investor experience? Which order type is more suitable for institutional investors with high capital?", "com_reference": "All-or-none (AON) orders differ from traditional market orders in that they instruct the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction. This means that the order will not be partially filled, and it will only be executed if all the shares can be obtained at once. This can result in the order not being filled if there is insufficient liquidity at a single price level. AON orders are generally only available for larger order sizes (e.g., 300 or 400 shares) and are typically day orders that expire at market close if not filled.\n\nFor institutional investors with high capital, all-or-none orders may be more suitable as they allow for more control over order execution. Institutional investors often place large orders relative to the average trading volume, and using AON orders can help prevent their orders from moving the market if filled in pieces. This can be beneficial in managing price differences across time and reducing the administrative burden associated with tracking multiple partial fills.\n\nIn contrast, traditional market orders are more commonly used by small-time investors or traders who prioritize immediate execution over price control. Market orders are executed at the current market price, which means that the order may be filled at various price levels, depending on volume and bid-ask spreads. This can lead to potential price slippage and may not be ideal for large orders where price impact is a concern."}

But until they provide the good or service, they don't have to accept it.   In this case, you want the service of depositing money.  But by its nature, they have to accept the payment first.  In that situation, they can refuse it.  There is no law that banks have to accept your deposits.  If they don't want you as a customer, that's their problem.   Consider switching banks.  Historically this was easier and some banks may still do things the old way.  Call your local banks and ask.  Perhaps you'll find someone happy to do business with you, on your terms.   As already said, some coin rolling machines will pay you with gift certificates.  If you plan to buy a sufficient amount from the place that accepts the gift certificate, this can get that place to play the fee.  That may help you, although it is obviously a limited solution.  The goal is to make it so that you only make purchases that you would have anyway.  The seller obviously has a different goal.   It's possible to buy coin sorters.  Heck, you could buy one with a gift certificate from a public machine.  Cheap ones require extra work to get the coins rolled and may jam a lot.  More expensive ones do more of the work for you.  Note that a given sorter that works better may be cheaper than another that doesn't work as well.  Cheap is more of a qualitative judgment than a financial measure in this case.   If you carry a small amount of change with you, pretty much everywhere accepts small amounts of change for purchases.  So if you have been always paying with dollars and dumping the change in a jar, instead always give the correct change (coins).  They may still give you dollars in change, but at least you won't get new coins.  And you'll use some of your existing coins.  Of course, this doesn't scale well.   For small purchases, say $1.50, you can often pay the whole thing in change without argument.  Or if something is $18.50, you might give them $10, $5, two $1 bills, and the rest in change.   If you are buying something and can see that they have little change in one of the coin buckets, offer to swap some change for bills.  Sometimes places find that easier than breaking a roll.   With vending machines, use change instead of dollar bills.  Especially use exact change so as not to convert bills to change.  They usually don't take pennies, but they're great with nickels and above.   This won't allow you to use change as a way to force yourself to save.  But it will keep your change down to a manageable level going forward.  And you might be able to use up your existing store.  I'm assuming that this isn't a fifty year coin collection that you are just now starting to process.  But if you have six months of change, you should be able to use it up in a year or so.   I tend to do this.  So I rarely have more than a couple dollars in change.  No one ever tells me that they don't take change, because I don't give anyone a lot.  Maybe $.99 here but more likely $.43 there.  Sometimes I give them, e.g., $.07 so as to get $.25 in change rather than $.18.   It's a little more work at every transaction, but it saves the big clump of work of rolling the coins.

This allows customers to deposit their coins directly into their bank account without having to incur extra costs or go through the process of exchanging coins for gift certificates. However, if a customer finds a coin rolling machine that offers a gift certificate for a store they frequent, this option could also be beneficial as it can be a way to convert coins into value that can be redeemed for goods or services at that specific store.

Especially if they're suggesting a lower number than you expected, since they get paid on commission and so may be biased the other way.  Part of their job is to look for hints about how motivated this seller is and what price they might accept, as opposed to what price they hope to get.  And remember that the default assumption is that the two parties will meet in the middle somewhere, which means it's customary to offer 10% less to signal that you could probably be talked into it if they drop the price about 5%. This is like bridge-hand bidding: it's a semi-formalized system of hints about levels of interest, except with fewer conventions and less rationality. As far as the seller paying the closing costs: that's really part of the same negotiation, and doing it that way makes the discussion more complicated for the seller since they need to figure out how much more to charge you to cover this cost.

But if you don't like and mostly trust your agent, you are working with the wrong agent.

By starting with a lower offer, it indicates that there is room for adjustment and that you are open to considering different price points. This behavior can signal flexibility and readiness to negotiate further without immediately conceding to the seller's initial price.\n\nOne tactic that signals flexibility without undermining your position is to express interest and commitment to the property while also emphasizing the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This can be done by showing appreciation for the property, highlighting specific aspects that you value, and expressing a desire to make the deal work for both parties.

Houses are perpetually falling down, and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well - particularly in bad areas. Accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 5-20% range per year depending on the property/area. Add insurance to this as well or be prepared to lose the whole thing in a disaster. Related to 1), they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve, when in reality a lot of the house price 'rise' is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up. No investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1) so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth (in your example, they could well be lagging inflation/barely growing if you are not pricing in upkeep and depreciation properly). Failure to price in the huge transaction costs (often 5%+ per sale) and capital gains/other taxes (depends on the exact tax structure where you are). These add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently. Costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents. Having to fill, check, evict, fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise, and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone else’s. Again, has to be factored in. Liquidity issues. Selling houses in down markets is very, very hard. They are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly. Houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices. As the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage (rents collapse, loss of job etc) they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system (negative equity etc). These factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses. Finally, if you’re young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited. Renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise. Locking yourself into 20 yr+ contracts/landlord activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential. Without more details on the exact legal framework, area, house type etc it’s hard to give more specific advise, but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above, so if the numbers you’re running are coming out close (and they are here), it’s probably not worth it, and you’re better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds.", "com_question": "How do property investments differ in terms of factors like depreciation, transaction costs, and liquidity? Which investment approach provides a larger margin of safety for long-term financial growth?", "com_reference": "In the given passage, property investments are highlighted as having several key factors that can differ from other types of investments. \n\nRegarding depreciation, the writer points out that property investments require factoring in the ongoing depreciation of the property due to wear and tear, as well as potential damages caused by tenants. This is a unique factor to consider when compared to other types of investments like stocks and bonds, which do not have physical properties that deteriorate over time.\n\nTransaction costs are also emphasized as a significant consideration for property investments, with costs such as sales commissions and taxes potentially eating into the returns from a property sale. These costs can be higher than the transaction costs typically associated with stocks and bonds, making property investments less liquid and potentially more expensive to trade.\n\nLiquidity is another distinguishing factor for property investments. Unlike stocks and bonds, which can be easily bought and sold on the market, properties can take a long time to sell, especially in down markets. This lack of liquidity can pose a challenge for property investors who may need to access their funds quickly.\n\nIn terms of providing a larger margin of safety for long-term financial growth, the passage suggests that property investments require a very large margin of safety due to the various risks involved, such as depreciation, transaction costs, and liquidity issues. The writer implies that if the numbers do not show a substantial margin of safety when considering these factors, it may be wiser to stick with more hands-off investments like stocks and bonds.\n\nIn conclusion, property investments differ from other types of investments in terms of depreciation, transaction costs, and liquidity, and they may require a larger margin of safety for long-term financial growth due to these unique factors."}

While it maximises the growth of the bankroll, it does so in a way that still leaves you very likely to experience massive (50%+) reductions in capital. Most long terms users of Kelly tend to stick in the 1/4 to 1/2 Kelly unit range to try and stay sane and retain a margin of error. See below for how large the typical swings can be with full Kelly:  2) Garbage in, garbage out. If you are making errors in pricing your actual edge, Kelly becomes very wrong very fast, easily leading you to a high chance of ruin if you are over estimating your true edge. As most people do massively over estimate their edges, Kelly simply pushes them far into territory where risk of ruin is high. 3) A Kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over non likely ones, even to the point where they prefer a smaller % edge if the chances of winning are better. Compare the below comparison of growth between two betting scenarios (decimal odds, so for the percantage chances do 1/odds):  In this case, despite the percentage edge on the red bet being higher than that of the green, in terms of bankroll growth it ends up only being roughly as good to a kelly gambler as the smaller edge on the more likely event. This has an obvious effect on the types of edges you should be seeking out if given choices between liklihoods.", "com_question": "How does Full Kelly staking compare with 1/4 to 1/2 Kelly range in terms of capital preservation?

Currency swaps can help mitigate currency risk by locking in exchange rates for a specific period, while shorting the ZAR can potentially generate profits if the currency depreciates. However, shorting the ZAR carries higher risks as it involves speculating on currency movements and may result in losses if the ZAR appreciates instead.\n\nUltimately, the choice between currency swaps and shorting the ZAR depends on your investment goals, risk appetite, and market conditions during a currency crisis. It's advisable to seek advice from a financial professional before making any decisions."}

NSF (Non-Sufficient Funds) fees: This is charged when you don't have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, and the bank declines the payment. The fees for bounced checks or declined debit card purchases are usually high.\n\n3. Overdraft lines of credit: Some banks offer lines of credit specifically for overdrafts. This means that instead of paying an NSF fee, you will pay interest on the amount overdrawn. This can be a cost-effective option if you frequently have insufficient funds.\n\n4. Automatic withdrawals from a linked account: Some banks allow you to link another account, such as a savings account or credit card, to cover shortages automatically. This can help you avoid NSF fees but may still incur interest charges.\n\nOverall, the most cost-effective way to cover shortages would typically be to opt for an overdraft line of credit if you qualify, as you would only pay interest when tapping into that line instead of incurring high NSF fees for each transaction. Additionally, setting up automatic transfers from a linked account could also be a more affordable option compared to paying NSF fees.

{"ID": "fiqa_823", "context": "\"I will add one thought on to this thread.  This is a financial concept called \"\"Net Present Value\"\".  In plain English, it means \"\"What's the best use for your money right now?\"\" So, let's say you have an extra €300/month which is not being spent on living expenses. If you leave that money under your pillow (or spend it on beer or fancy electronics!) instead of paying off your startersloan early, that is costing you 300*(0.04/12) per month, every month.  So €1/month, or €12/year.  This is cumulative for the life of your loan.  So not paying €300 this month will ultimately cost you €120 assuming you keep the loan open for 10 years.  If you're saying \"\"pay my debts or spend the money on a snappy smartphone?\"\" the answer is that you should pay your debts. Now, here's the important part.  Let's suppose you have a better use for the money than beer or electronics.  Let's suppose you have a mutual fund which will reliably provide you with a return of 10% a year. If you put that €300/month into a high-yield fund, and if the returns are consistent, you are STILL paying that €12/year (because you invested elsewhere and didn't pay your debts), but you are realizing profits of 300*(0.1/12)=€2.5/month on the invested money.  €2.5-1=€1.5/month, which is a net gain.

Cryptocurrency:\n- Cryptocurrency investments involve buying digital assets that operate independently of traditional financial systems.\n- The value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and subject to speculation.\n- Cryptocurrencies do not provide any fixed income or interest payments like bonds.\n\nFor stability and passive income, corporate bonds are generally considered a more suitable option. Corporate bonds offer a fixed income stream through regular interest payments and are considered lower-risk investments compared to stocks and cryptocurrency. Stocks and cryptocurrency can offer higher returns but also come with higher risks and volatility."}
{"ID": "fiqa_830", "context": "\"The tax system in general, and income tax in particular, is used for several purposes at once. One of those purposes is to raise money to run the government. It isn't the only purpose of income tax, and income tax isn't the only source of money to run the government. Try a thought experiment: let's say it costs $10,000 per person per year to run the government. (It might actually cost far more or far less, that's not the point.) A super simple tax system would just ask each person for $10,000. But such a system isn't fair. Some people don't even earn $10,000 so they are literally not able to pay that. Some people, who earn a lot, can easily afford to pay more. So a still-pretty simple approach asks each person to pay a particular percentage of their income, and the hope is that this will add up to enough to run the government. This still doesn't feel fair to everyone - 10% of your income is hard to find when you're spending it all on rent and food, and easy to find when you have way more than you \"\"need\"\". So many countries have what's called a \"\"progressive\"\" system of income tax where you pay no tax on the first X of your income, then a small percentage on the next Y, a larger percentage on the next Z and so on.  But you asked about business profit. Some places don't tax business profits at all - they just collect income taxes on people once the money reaches them as salary or dividends. Other places do. Just as a person who doesn't earn any income can't send the government money, a business that spent more on expenses than it brought in as revenue can't send the government money either. So the tax is on profit. That seems fairer to most people anyway. Things then get even more complicated for both business and personal income taxes because the government uses the system to encourage certain behaviours and to help people facing hard times. If you want to encourage people to get training and move into higher paying jobs, you might make tuition tax deductible. Most countries give a tax deduction for each small child you have. This isn't because people with children use less of the services government provides, is it? Instead it's an acknowledgement that people with children generally have less money to spend. Or an encouragement to have children, or something. Tax motivations are complicated.  If you charged all businesses a flat tax regardless of whether they were making or losing money, people might be hesitant to start companies that lose money at first. There might be less entrepreneurship in that country. If instead you only tax profits, it feels fairer and more people are likely to join in. So that's what most governments do. Is the imaginary business owner who is not turning a profit somehow getting a free ride? They are still paying tax. If they took any salary for themselves, there was personal income tax on that. Everything the company bought, it paid sales tax on. There may have been excise taxes and such in other things they bought. The economic activity of the business has been driving the wheel of the local economy and spinning off some taxes at various levels that whole time. Whether the business itself is chipping in some corporate income tax too may not end up being particularly relevant. Example: a sole proprietor has revenue of $100,000 and spends $10,000 on supplies and such. If the salary to the owner is $89,000 the company has a $1000 profit which it pays tax on. If the salary to the owner is $91,000 the company has a $1000 loss and doesn't pay tax (and may be able to use the loss to reduce taxes in a future year.) So what? The owner is paying personal income tax on roughly $90,000. The government is getting the support it needs. Yes, some owners do all the \"\"encouraged\"\" things so that some income is not taxed either in the business or the personal sphere. That is presumably what the government wanted when it set those things up as deductions. Making charitable contributions, hiring new employees, building new facilities ... essentially the government is paying the business to do those things because they're good for the country. The overall government budget (funded by personal and corporate income tax along with sales tax, excises taxes etc) is supposed to achieve certain goals which include roads and schools but also job creation and the like. This is one of the ways they do that.\"", "com_question": "In comparison for tax systems, how does the treatment of business profit differ from personal income, and what motivates these differential tax approaches?", "com_reference": "In comparing tax systems, the treatment of business profit differs from personal income in that business profit is taxed independently from personal income. Business profit is subject to corporate income tax, which is applied to the profits earned by a business after deducting expenses from revenues. On the other hand, personal income tax is levied on the income individuals earn from various sources, such as salaries, wages, and investments.\n\nThe motivation behind these differential tax approaches lies in the goals and objectives that governments aim to achieve through taxation. For personal income tax, the focus is often on equity and progressivity, ensuring that individuals contribute to government revenue based on their ability to pay. This is why personal income tax rates are often structured in a progressive manner, with higher-income earners paying a greater proportion of their income in taxes.\n\nWhen it comes to business profit taxation, the motivation includes not only raising revenue for government operations but also incentivizing certain behaviors and economic activities. Taxing business profits encourages entrepreneurship and investment in profitable ventures. Moreover, it helps ensure that businesses are contributing their fair share to the overall tax revenue while promoting economic growth and job creation.\n\nOverall, the differential treatment of business profit and personal income in tax systems reflects the complex interplay of economic, social, and policy considerations that governments must balance to achieve their fiscal and societal goals."}

Traditional performance measurements focus more on operational efficiency and output metrics, while modern performance measurements emphasize outcomes and impact on business goals.\n\nIn the tech industry, modern performance measurements are often considered more effective at identifying high performers because they go beyond basic productivity metrics and take into account the overall impact of an individual's work on the organization's success.

They may also need to pay estimated taxes throughout the year, as they do not have an employer withholding taxes from their income.\n\nIn terms of which approach is more beneficial in terms of taxes paid and regulations followed, it can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each individual. Generally, self-employed individuals have more flexibility in terms of deductions and expenses they can claim on their tax returns, which can help reduce their tax liability. However, they are also responsible for paying self-employment taxes, which can result in higher overall tax payments compared to employees.\n\nIt is important for self-employed individuals to keep detailed records of their income and expenses, as well as stay informed about tax laws and regulations that apply to their business activities. Consulting with a tax professional or accountant can also help them navigate the complexities of self-employment taxes and ensure they are compliant with all requirements.\n\nUltimately, the most beneficial approach will depend on factors such as income levels, deductible expenses, and individual circumstances, so it is recommended to seek personalized advice from a tax professional to determine the best course of action."}

Regulatory agencies have the authority to set and enforce standards, conduct audits, investigate violations, and impose penalties when necessary. On the other hand, self-regulation by industries relies on the willingness and capability of businesses to uphold standards without external intervention, which can sometimes lead to conflicts of interest or inadequate oversight.\n\nOverall, while there are arguments for both approaches, government oversight through regulatory agencies is generally considered to be more effective in ensuring consumer safety and well-being, as it provides a framework for consistent enforcement and accountability across industries. Industry self-regulation may have its merits in certain cases, but it should not replace the role of regulatory agencies in protecting public interests and maintaining standards."}

These are usually the items that the buyer purchases as part of the process: home inspection, credit check. These expenses take place early in the process and if the deal falls through due to the inspection or credit history problems the seller doesn't want to get stuck paying for. The buyer will frequently have to write a check for these as they occur. Other items occur later in the process or even at the very end of the process. Determining which side pays for each item is a combination negotiation and local tradition. Even for the items that the buyer has to pay for, there can be a negotiation between the  buyer and the lender. Sometimes the lender allows the buyer to roll the closing costs into the loan, this does mean that they will be paying interest on the closing costs for years. But not rolling in the closing costs mean that you need more cash on hand. This is in addition to the down-payment and the costs of moving.   The closing costs covered by the seller reduce the size of the check they will receive at the end of the process. Their willingness to kick in this cash is a function of will they still make money on the deal, how many other bidders there were, and do they need the cash to buy their next house. At settlement the forms identify each item involved and who agreed to pay for it, then each side is credited for the items they paid for already. Then each side either writes a check for the balance due or receives a check for their reimbursement. Keep in mind there are also money exchanges that take place at the closing that are not covered by the buyer: real estate commissions. There are also items such as interest for the current month, and property tax credit that depend on the day of the month and month of the year.  Sit down with your agent or your lender to get an idea of what you need to pay before closing.  Though telling everybody that you will have zero cash to pay for these things may make the lender very nervous about approving a loan.", "com_question": "In determining closing costs for home buying, how do upfront expenses differ from costs paid at closing? When negotiating these costs, what factors influence seller contributions and buyer responsibilities?", "com_reference": "Upfront expenses in the home buying process, such as the home inspection and credit check, are items that the buyer typically pays for early on and prior to closing. These expenses are associated with the initial stages of the purchasing process and are typically borne by the buyer because if the deal falls through, the seller does not want to be responsible for these costs. On the other hand, costs paid at closing occur later in the process or at the very end, and determining which side is responsible for each cost is usually a result of negotiation and local tradition.\n\nIn negotiating these costs, factors that influence seller contributions and buyer responsibilities include whether the seller can still make a profit on the deal, the level of competition from other buyers, and whether the seller requires the cash to purchase their next home. Seller contributions toward closing costs help reduce the amount they will receive at the end of the process, and this willingness is often influenced by various factors including the ones mentioned above.\n\nIt is important to carefully review the specific items involved in the closing costs and who is expected to pay for them. Consulting with your agent or lender to understand what expenses need to be paid before closing and having cash on hand to cover these costs can be crucial for a successful home buying process. However, it's also essential to be mindful that conveying an inability to cover these expenses entirely may cause concern for the lender when it comes to approving a loan."}

If the earnings are above a specific amount, they may be taxed at the parents' tax rate through the \"kiddie tax\" rule. On the other hand, trusts themselves are taxed, and they have their own tax returns.\n\nIn terms of control over spending, UTMA/UGMA accounts require a custodian to sign off on withdrawals until the child attains majority, at which point the child can spend the money as they wish. With trusts, the terms and conditions of the trust dictate how and when the funds can be accessed and used, providing more control over spending compared to UTMA/UGMA accounts.\n\nFrom a financial security standpoint, trusts may offer better financial security for minors as they provide more control over how funds are managed and spent. Trusts can have specific provisions on how the funds are to be used and distributed, ensuring that the assets are protected and managed according to the wishes of the grantor. Additionally, trusts may offer more flexibility in terms of tax planning and asset protection compared to UTMA/UGMA accounts.\n\nUltimately, the decision between UTMA/UGMA accounts and trusts will depend on individual circumstances, objectives, and preferences regarding tax implications and control over spending for minors.

Transparency and accountability: Implement measures to hold law enforcement accountable for unethical behavior, such as planting evidence or engaging in corrupt practices.

On the other hand, increasing share capital does not create a liability, as the owners are purchasing additional shares in the company rather than lending money that must be repaid.\n\nIn terms of safeguarding owners' investments, increasing share capital is generally considered to be a safer approach. This is because increasing share capital represents a long-term investment in the company, and the owners have a proportional ownership stake in the company based on the shares they hold.

Usually, debt holders (especially holders of senior debt) are paid first, and you're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off. More often than not, equity holders probably won't get much. To give an example, corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options: liquidation or reorganization. In the US, these are called Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy, respectively. Canada and the United Kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations, although in the UK, reorganization is often referred to as administration. Many countries have similar procedures in place. I'll use the US as an example because it's what I'm most familiar with. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the company is liquidated to pay its debts. Investopedia's article about bankruptcy states: During Chapter 7 bankruptcy, investors are considered especially low on the ladder. Usually, the stock of a company undergoing Chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless, and investors lose the money they invested. If you hold a bond, you might receive a fraction of its face value. What you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page. In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization. The Investopedia article quotes the SEC to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens: \"\"During Chapter 11 bankruptcy, bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments, and stockholders stop receiving dividends. If you are a bondholder, you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds, new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds. If you are a stockholder, the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company. The new shares may be fewer in number and worth less. The reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive, if anything, from the company.\"\" The exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that's worked out, local laws, court agreements, etc.. For example, in the case of General Motor's bankruptcy, stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company.\"", "com_question": "In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, what typically happens to stockholders compared to bondholders?

The new shares they receive may be fewer in number and worth less than their original stock. Bondholders may receive new stock, new bonds, or a combination of both in exchange for their bonds.\n\nIn general, Chapter 11 bankruptcy may provide slightly better outcomes for equity holders as they have the potential to receive shares in the reorganized company.

{"ID": "fiqa_950", "context": "\"These policies are usually called dread disease policies or critical illness insurance, and they normally aren't a good deal. Furthermore, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, such policies may become less common or disappear entirely. These policies aren't a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information, two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance. When you purchase an insurance policy, the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool, e.g. you and your fellow employees, if you get insurance through your employer. For health insurance, this average risk level is the average probability that you'll incur healthcare costs. The insurer's actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors, like your age, sex, current health, socioeconomic status, etc. Asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does. For example, you may look like a relatively low-risk individual on paper, but little does the insurance company know, BASE jumping is one of your hobbies. Because you know about your hobby and the insurance company doesn't, you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects. If the insurance company knew this, they would like to charge you a much higher premium, if they could. However, they can't, because a) they don't know about your hobby, and b) the premium may be decided for the entire group/risk pool, so they can't increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance. You may decide that because of your dangerous hobby, you do want to take advantage of your employer's healthcare plan. Unfortunately for the insurance company, they can't adjust their price accordingly. Adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets, so I didn't go into much detail here (too much detail is probably off-topic anyway). I can point you towards more resources on the topic if you're interested.  However, the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy.  By expressing interest in such a specific policy, e.g. a cancer insurance policy, you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease. In your case, you're signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it, and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk. Since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness, they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it. However, when you express interest in a disease-specific policy, this signals the existence of asymmetric information (your family history or other habits), and the insurer assumes you know something they don't that elevates your risk level of that specific disease. Since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies, the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them. They can charge you a higher premium because you've signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly above-average risk of contracting a specific disease*. Also, the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease. The policy will be priced accordingly, i.e. in such a way that isn't necessarily beneficial to you. Furthermore, most dread disease policies aren't guaranteed renewable, which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums, the insurance company doesn't have to keep insuring you. As your risk of developing the specific disease grows, e.g. with age, it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk. The company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles, so they decide not to renew your policy. The end result? The insurance company has the premiums you've paid previously, but you no longer have coverage for that illness, and ex post, you've suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future.  Dread disease policies are changing under the Affordable Care Act. According to healthcare.gov Starting in 2014, ... all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses, and plans purchased in the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges, must include a range of essential health benefits. The essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage; since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it, dread disease policies wouldn't seem to qualify. For more information, you can read the linked page on healthcare.gov or see Section 1302, subsection b), titled \"\"Essential Health Benefits Requirements\"\" in the law itself (p87). I imagine more details will be available on a state-by-state basis through 2014 and into 2015.  One legal source (see the discussion on p24) states that: whatever else the ACA does with excepted benefit policies, including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies, it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the ACA This seems pretty straightforward; a dread disease (or \"\"specific disease\"\" policy, as it's referred to in the article), won't count towards the minimum essential requirements. This may not be an issue for you, but for others, it's important to understand that you'll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies. The ACA spells this out in Section 5000(f) (see p316, which states that \"\"excepted benefit policies\"\" are excluded and defines them using the definition in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). **The PSHA specifically includes \"\"Coverage only for a specified disease or illness\"\" in their definition of \"\"excepted benefit policies\"\" (see section 2791(b), paragraph 3A on p82, so it's probably a safe bet that such policies won't count towards the minimum. Also, as Rick pointed out in the comments, the Affordable Care Act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans, so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease you're worried about, such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit. Deductibles, annual limits, and other factors may complicate this somewhat.  In the section about lifetime limits (Sec. 2711, p2), the Affordable Care Act states that: A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish ... lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary.  However, the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law The section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits, so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies. The law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the law's implementation is left up to individual states. Furthermore, certain parts of the law specify actions involving the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so these may require further codification in the future too. You should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract (see the next section).  Since a dread disease policy probably isn't a good idea, you'll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area (if your employer doesn't offer coverage). I've tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start. These points may change once the Affordable Care Act is implemented, so I'll try to keep them as general as possible.  Services - Above and beyond the minimum essential requirements, what services does the plan offer? Are these services a good match for you and/or your family, or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit? For example, my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small co-pay, so I don't need a separate dental plan, even though my employer offers one.  Choice - What doctors, clinics, hospitals, etc. are preferred providers under your plan? Do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist, or can you find one on your own? Are the preferred providers convenient for you? In my first year of college (about five years ago), my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach. This is something to keep in mind, depending on where you live.  Costs - This is a major one, obviously. Deductibles, copays, maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime, out-of-network costs, etc. are all variables to consider.  There are other factors, but since I don't have a family, other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies.  In place of a dread disease policy, you're likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy, perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once you've exhausted your standard insurance policy. However, this may be a moot point since the passage of the Affordable Care Act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway.\"", "com_question": "In contrast to conventional health insurance, how do dread disease policies differ? Which type offers more comprehensive coverage without lifetime limits?", "com_reference": "In contrast to conventional health insurance, dread disease policies are specific and offer coverage for a particular illness or disease, such as cancer. Dread disease policies differ from conventional health insurance in that they are more focused and provide targeted coverage for a specific ailment. On the other hand, conventional health insurance typically offers broader coverage for a range of healthcare services and conditions.\n\nRegarding lifetime limits, dread disease policies may have limitations or exclusions related to lifetime coverage for non-essential benefits. In contrast, conventional health insurance under the Affordable Care Act does not allow for lifetime limits on essential health benefits, ensuring more comprehensive coverage without lifetime restrictions. Therefore, conventional health insurance offers more comprehensive coverage without lifetime limits compared to dread disease policies."}

Again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and garnishing wages from your friend to going to small claims court.  Part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution.  By letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you - they are good at tracking people down for free. Also the lender may be able to give you options.  For example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty.  If a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default.  If they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you.  I worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping.  It went down like this... Co-signer gets pissed like you and calls bank, bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default, cosigner defaults, banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle, cosigner helps or actually repos vehicle, bank gets car back, bank inspects car, bank asks cosigner for X amount (sometimes nothing but not usually), cosigner pays X, bank does not hit cosigners credit, bank releases loan and sells car.

For the most part I would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100% of the details.   The other part is cosigning the loan.  Why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend?  Most parents won't cosign a loan for their own kids.  And if you are cosigning a loan, you write up a simple contract and make the non-payment penalties extremely costly for your friend.

Which approach is most effective in recovering the debt?", "com_reference": "Cosigning a loan can have serious consequences if the primary borrower defaults, as the cosigner becomes responsible for repaying the debt. In contrast, pursuing the asset or contacting the lending institution can be more effective in recovering the debt as it involves directly going after the collateral or seeking assistance from the institution to facilitate the repayment process.\n\nIn this specific scenario, the passage suggests that going after the asset or working with the lending institution may be more practical options for recovering the debt. By pursuing the asset, such as repossessing a car or placing a lien on a house, the lender can potentially recoup some or all of the owed amount. Additionally, involving the lending institution can help in exploring options like clearing out the debt by returning the asset or collaborating on a plan for repayment.\n\nWhile seeking legal advice is dismissed in the passage as potentially costly and time-consuming, it may still be beneficial in certain situations where other approaches have failed. Consulting with a lawyer can provide guidance on the best course of action based on the specific circumstances and legal options available.\n\nUltimately, the most effective approach in recovering the debt will depend on the individual circumstances of the loan agreement and the willingness of the borrower to cooperate.

{"ID": "fiqa_989", "context": "Since you seem determined to consider this, I'd like to break down for you why I believe it is an incredibly risky proposition: 1) In general, picking individual stocks is risky. Individual stocks are by their nature not diversified assets, and a single company-wide calamity (a la Volkswagen emissions, etc.) can create huge distress to your investments. The way to mitigate this risk is of course to diversify (invest in other types of assets, such as other stocks, index funds, bonds, etc.). However, you must accept that this first step does have risks.  2) Picking stocks on the basis of financial information (called 'fundamental analysis') requires a very large amount of research and time dedication. It is one of the two main schools of thought in equity investing (as opposed to 'technical analysis', which pulls information directly from stock markets, such as price volatility). This is something that professional investors do for a living - and that means that they have an edge you do not have, unless you dedicate similar resources to this task. That information imbalance between you and professional traders creates additional risk where you make determinations 'against the grain'.  3) Any specific piece of public information (and this is public information, regardless of how esoteric it is) may be considered to be already 'factored into' public stock prices. I am a believer in market efficiency first and foremost. That means I believe that anything publically known related to a corporation ['OPEC just lowered their oil production! Exxon will be able to increase their prices!'] has already been considered by the professional traders currently buying and selling in the market. For your 'new' information to be valuable, it would need to have the ability to forecast earnings in a way not already considered by others. 4) I doubt you will be able to find the true nature of the commercial impact of a particular event, simply by knowing ship locations. So what if you know Alcoa is shipping Aluminium to Cuba - is this one of 5 shipments already known to the public? Is this replacement supplies that are covering a loss due to damaged goods previously sent? Is the boat only 1/3 full? Where this information gets valuable, is when it gets to the level of corporate espionage. Yes, if you had ship manifests showing tons of aluminum being sold, and if this was a massive 'secret' shipment about to be announced at the next shareholders' meeting, you could (illegally) profit from that information. 5) The more massive the company, the less important any single transaction is. That means the super freighters you may see transporting raw commodities could have dozens of such ships out at any given time, not to mention news of new mine openings and closures, price changes, volume reports, etc. etc. So the most valuable information would be smaller companies, where a single shipment might cover a month of revenue - but such a small company is (a) less likely to be public [meaning you couldn't buy shares in the company and profit off of the information]; and (b) less likely to be found by you in the giant sea of ship information. In summary, while you may have found some information that provides insight into a company's operations, you have not shown that this information is significant and also unknown to the market. Not to mention the risks associated with picking individual stocks in the first place. In this case, it is my opinion that you are taking on additional risk not adequately compensated by additional reward.", "com_question": "How does individual stock picking compare in risk to diversified assets? Which investment approach offers better risk-reward balance?", "com_reference": "Individual stock picking is generally considered riskier compared to investing in diversified assets. This is because individual stocks are not diversified assets by nature, and their performance can be highly volatile due to factors specific to that company. On the other hand, diversified assets, such as index funds or a mix of different stocks and bonds, spread the risk across multiple assets, reducing the impact of any single company's poor performance.\n\nIn terms of risk-reward balance, investing in diversified assets typically offers a better balance. While individual stock picking potentially offers higher returns if the selected stocks perform well, it also comes with a greater risk of significant losses if those stocks underperform or face unforeseen challenges. Diversified assets provide a more stable and predictable return over the long term, with lower risk due to the broader exposure to different sectors and companies."}

{"ID": "fiqa_992", "context": "That makes no sense at all. They try to compare and that's exactly the same as comparing apples versus oranges. Mortgage is long-term loan, so for the first many years the huge part of the payment will go to repaying interest, so that ratio 1 will indeed be something like 20% or more despite the fact that the interest rate on the mortgage is much lower - something around 6%. HELOC will have the interest rate of 6%, but it will have the same structure so that you have equal payments, so if you compute that ratio 1 it will be very close to that of the mortgage. The bottom line is - if HELOCs were that great noone would apply for mortgages. You should stick to making extra payments towards the principal on the mortgage.", "com_question": "How does mortgage repayment structure compare to that of HELOC? Which option provides better long-term benefits?", "com_reference": "In the provided passage, the author compares the repayment structure of a mortgage to that of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). The author notes that for the first years of a mortgage, a significant portion of the payment goes towards repaying interest, resulting in a higher ratio of interest to principal. The writer claims that a HELOC has a similar repayment structure, leading to a comparable ratio of interest to principal as that of a mortgage.\n\nIn terms of long-term benefits, the author suggests that making extra payments towards the principal on the mortgage may be a better option than opting for a HELOC. The reasoning behind this is not explicitly stated in the passage, but the implied suggestion is that focusing on reducing the principal balance of the mortgage may provide better long-term financial benefits compared to the structure of a HELOC.\n\nOverall, the passage leans towards the idea that the mortgage repayment structure and the HELOC repayment structure are similar in terms of interest payments and that making extra payments towards the mortgage principal may offer better long-term benefits."}
