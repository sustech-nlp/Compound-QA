{"ID": "hotpot_qa_1", "context": "A sailor hat is a brimmed straw hat similar to those historically worn by nineteenth century sailors before the sailor cap became standard.  It is very close in appearance to the masculine boater, although \"sailors\" as worn by women and children have their own distinct design, typically flat-crowned, wide-brimmed and with a dark ribbon band extending into streamers hanging off the brim.  Such hats could also be made in felt as an alternative to straw. Il cappello di paglia di Firenze (literally translated as \"The Florentine Straw Hat\" but usually titled in English language productions as \"The Italian Straw Hat\") is an opera by Nino Rota to an Italian-language libretto by the composer and Ernesta Rota, based on the play \"Le chapeau de paille d'Italie\" by Eugène Labiche and Marc Michel. A straw hat is a brimmed hat that is woven out of straw or straw like materials from different plants or synthetics.  The hat is designed to protect the head from the sun and against heatstroke, but straw hats are also used in fashion as a decorative element or a uniform. The seventeenth season of the \"One Piece\" anime series was produced by Toei Animation, and directed by Hiroaki Miyamoto and Toshinori Fukuzawa.  The season began broadcasting in Japan on Fuji Television from January 19, 2014 to June 19, 2016.  Like the rest of the series, it follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates.  The first DVD compilation of this season was released on July 2, 2014, with individual volumes being released monthly.  The story arc, called \"Dressrosa\", adapts material beginning from the end of the 70th volume to the middle of the 80th volume of the manga by Eiichiro Oda.  The Straw Hats land in Dressrosa, an island controlled by the warlord Donquixote Doflamingo.  Upon learning of Doflamingo's conquering of the kingdom, the Straw Hats team up with the Revolutionaries and the kingdom's deposed princess Viola to overthrow Doflamingo and save the island, Dressrosa. A bergère (French for shepherdess) hat is a flat-brimmed straw hat with a shallow crown, usually trimmed with ribbon and flowers.  It could be worn in various ways with the brim folded back or turned up or down at whim.  It is also sometimes called a milkmaid hat.  It was widely worn in the mid-18th century, and versions may be seen in many British and French paintings of the period, such as \"The Swing\" by Fragonard, and in portraits by Thomas Gainsborough and Johann Zoffany, amongst others.  It has been suggested that the hat was named after Madame Bergeret, who is certainly holding a shepherdess-style hat in a Boucher portrait painted c.1766. Still Life with Straw Hat (\"Stillleben mit gelbem Strohhut\") also known as \"Still Life with Yellow Straw Hat\" and \"Still Life with Hat and Pipe\" was painted by Vincent van Gogh in late November - mid-December 1881 or possibly in 1885 in the town of Nuenen. A Panama hat (toquilla straw hat) is a traditional brimmed straw hat of Ecuadorian origin.  Traditionally, hats were made from the plaited leaves of the \"Carludovica palmata\" plant, known locally as the \"toquilla palm\" or \"jipijapa palm\", although it is a palm-like plant rather than a true palm. Straw Hat Pizza is a chain of pizza restaurants founded in 1959 in San Leandro, California. The Chapeau à la Paméla, Pamela hat or Pamela bonnet described a type of straw hat or bonnet popular during the 1790s and into the first three quarters of the 19th century.  It was named after the heroine of Samuel Richardson's 1741 novel \"Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded\".  While Pamela hats and bonnets underwent a variety of changes in shape and form, they were always made from straw.  The mid-19th-century version of the Pamela hat was a smaller version of an early 19th-century wide-brimmed style called the gipsy hat. The Straw Hat Riot of 1922 was a riot that occurred in New York City.  Originating as a series of minor riots, it spread due to men wearing straw hats past the unofficial date that was deemed socially acceptable, September 15.

Hernandez is a retired officer in the United States Army and the former commander of the United States Army Cyber Command which is the Army’s service component to U.S. Cyber Command.  Hernandez, as a major general, assumed the position upon its activation (which included the command receiving and perpetuating the lineage and honors of the former Second United States Army) on October 10, 2010, with its headquarters at Fort Belvoir Virginia.  He received a promotion to lieutenant general on March 25, 2011.  As head of US Army Cyber Command, Hernandez was responsible for planning, coordinating, and integrating the network operations and defense of all US Army networks.  Hernandez also was tasked with conducting cyberspace operations in support of Army operations through his command of approximately 21,000 soldiers and civilians.  Hernandez oversaw a command that brought an unprecedented unity of effort and synchronization of all Army forces operating within the cyber domain.  Under Hernandez, the command concentrated its efforts on operationalizing cyberspace and improving Army capabilities in the cyberspace domain.  As a first step, the command established the Army Cyber Operations and Integration Center collocating intelligence, operations, and signal staffs, together with a critical targeting function, and bringing a new synergy to Army cyberspace operations.  To improve the Army’s cyber capabilities the command fielded a World Class Cyber Opposing Force at the National Training Center; developed new doctrinal concepts for Land-Cyber operations; and identified the Army’s capability requirements needed to fully operationalize the cyberspace domain and grow the Army’s cyber force.  He currently serves on the Board of Advisors of the Military Cyber Professionals Association (MCPA). Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game \"Half-Life\".  The game was developed by Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on November 19, 1999.  \"Opposing Force\" is the first expansion for \"Half-Life\" and was first announced in April 1999.  Randy Pitchford, the lead designer on the game, later noted that he believed Gearbox was selected to develop \"Opposing Force\" because Valve wanted to concentrate on their future projects.  Over the course of development, Gearbox brought in a variety of outside talent from other areas of the video games industry to help bolster various aspects of design. In military tactics, a flanking maneuver, or flanking manoeuvre (also called a flank attack), is an attack on the sides of an opposing force.  If a flanking maneuver succeeds, the opposing force would be surrounded from two or more directions, which significantly reduces the maneuverability of the outflanked force and its ability to defend itself.

The Calgary Soldiers' Memorial is a war monument in Calgary, Alberta that was dedicated on April 9, 2011, the anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.  The monument is dedicated to Calgary area soldiers who have given their lives in war and military service overseas.  The monument is located on Memorial Drive. Memorial Drive (formerly \"Sunnyside Boulevard\") is a major road in Calgary, Alberta.  Besides having an important role in city infrastructure, the tree lined sides of Memorial Drive serve as a living testament to the many soldiers who died during World War I and give it a parkway look on the western section.  An active path system also runs along the south side of Memorial Drive, beside the banks of the Bow River.  The Calgary Soldiers' Memorial will form part of an extensive renovation to Memorial Drive, which will heighten the function of the road as a monument to the city's military.  The Landscape of Memory Project began in 2004, in order to revitalize a nine kilometre stretch of the road.

It does not consist of one trench or line of pillboxes, but rather a system, of varying degrees of complexity, of fighting positions and obstacles to enemy advance. The Battle of Cerami was fought in June 1063 and was one of the most significant battles in the Norman conquest of Sicily, 1060-1091.  The battle was fought between a Norman expeditionary force and a Muslim alliance of Sicilian and Zirid troops.  The Normans fought under the command of Roger de Hauteville, the youngest son of Tancred of Hauteville and brother of Robert Guiscard.  The Muslim alliance consisted of the native Sicilian Muslims under the Kalbid ruling class of Palermo, led by Ibn al-Hawas, and Zirid reinforcements from North Africa led by the two princes, Ayyub and 'Ali.  The battle was a resounding Norman victory that utterly routed the opposing force, causing divisions amongst the Muslim aristocracy which ultimately paved the way for the eventual capture of the Sicilian capital, Palermo, by the Normans and subsequently the rest of the island.

Athens hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 that included venues such as Panathinaiko Stadium and the city of Marathon for whom the long-distance race would be named for.  From the end of the 1896 Games until the late 1970s, Greece underwent numerous political changes that included the Balkan Wars, two World Wars, a civil war, and a military coup that resulted in a junta that lasted from 1967 to 1974.  A change in democracy in 1975 resulted in Greece's admission into the European Economic Community (European Union since 1993) in 1979.  Athens first bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics as part of the 100th anniversary of the Modern Olympics, but was upset by Atlanta, Georgia in the United States for the Games in 1990.  Seven years later, Athens won the right to host the 2004 Summer Olympics.  At the time of the award, 75% of competition and 92% of training venues were available though a massive construction and renovation program was taken to get the venues ready for the games.  Accessibility and environmental issues were taken into account in venue design and construction.  The marathon course used was the same one used for the 1896 Games though it was 2.195 km longer to the marathon not being standardized until 1924.  Canoe slalom's venue at Ellinikon was the first using saltwater, having it pumped in from the Aegean Sea.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_18", "context": "Alkene carboamination is the simultaneous formation of C–N and C–C bonds across an alkene.  This method represents a powerful strategy to build molecular complexity with up to two stereocenters in a single operation.  Generally, there are four categories of reaction modes for alkene carboamination.  The first class is cyclization reactions, which will form a N-heterocycle as a result.  The second class has been well established in the last decade.  Alkene substrates with a tethered nitrogen nucleophile have been used in these transformations to promote intramolecular aminocyclization.  While intermolecular carboamination is extremely hard, people have developed a strategy to combine the nitrogen and carbon part, which is known as the third class.  The most general carboamination, which takes three individual parts and couples them together is still underdeveloped. Caltopia is a free, two-day college lifestyle festival that takes place annually at the University of California, Berkeley in the Recreational Sports Facility (RSF) and according to the organizers of the event is the largest college lifestyle festival in the United States. The Great Quadrangle, more popularly known as Tom Quad, is one of the quadrangles of Christ Church, Oxford, England.  It is the largest college quad in Oxford, measuring 264 by 261 feet.  Although it was begun by Cardinal Wolsey, he was unable to complete it.  Wolsey planned that it would actually be a cloister, and the supports required for this can be seen at short intervals around the quadrangle.  The quad was finished when John Fell was Dean.  The funds for the building of Tom Quad were found from the suppression of three Norbertine abbeys.  It is dominated to the west by Tom Tower, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.  On the east side is the entrance to Christ Church Cathedral and at the south-east corner is the entrance to the college dining hall.  The north contains the homes of the canons of Christ Church, and much of the east side is taken up with the Deanery, in which the Dean of the college lives.  On the north-east side, the quad leads, via Kilcannon, to Peckwater Quadrangle and the college library.  In the north-west part of the quad is the Junior Common Room (\"JCR\").  Parts of the quad are still lived in by undergraduates, including the staircase above the Porter's lodge, known as \"Bachelors' Row\", to the left of the quadrangle when entered via Tom Gate.  Bachelors' Row was only inhabited by first year male undergraduates until 2014, when the first female first year undergraduates took up residence there.

The Apple Intermediate Codec is a high-quality 8-bit 4:2:0 video codec used mainly as a less processor-intensive way of working with long-GOP MPEG-2 footage such as HDV.  It is recommended for use with all HD workflows in Final Cut Express, iMovie, and until Final Cut Pro version 5.  The Apple Intermediate Codec abbreviated AIC (by users, Apple Engineers don't use the abbreviation) is designed by Apple Inc. to be an intermediate format in an HDV and AVCHD workflow.  It features high performance and quality, being less processor intensive to work with than other editing formats.  Unlike native MPEG-2 based HDV - and similar to the standard-definition DV codec - the Apple Intermediate Codec does not use temporal compression, enabling every frame to be decoded immediately without decoding other frames.  As a result of this, the Apple Intermediate Codec takes three to four times more space than HDV.", "com_question": "What is the largest college at University of California, Berkley?

The head family of this tribe is living since long at Trand and other two families are living in \"Maidan\" and \"Tamaie\".  This tribe was migrated from pakistan thal city near Hangu when English were ruling the India before the Partition of India.  As Wardak are very famous for their bravery so this tribe was fighting with the Sikh and Hindus at Battagram.  The grandfather of these three major families was allowed to walk on a horse in the area as a tradition of a hero man.  They fought many on foot wars at the district very bravely with the locals of the area.  Later on when their grandfather killed a well known man of the area.  They were compelled to leave the place.  At night they killed some of the servants of the Khan of Battagram and their animals as well and started moving towards the Trand.  The head family of Bahadar remain there while the other two families were transferred to \"Maidan\" and \"Tamaie\". Precipitated by separate personal tragedies, two families flee their rural livings to share a \"great continent of a house\", Cloudstreet, in the Perth suburb of West Leederville.  The two families are contrasts to each other; the Lambs find meaning in industry and in God's grace; the Pickles, in luck.  The Lambs' God is a maker of miracles; the Pickles' God is the ‘Shifty Shadow’ of fate.  Though initially resistant to each other, their search and journey for meaning in life concludes with the uniting of the two families with many characters citing this as the most important aspect of their lives.  As a novel, Cloudstreet is tightly structured, opening and ending with a shared celebratory family picnic - a joyous occasion which, ironically, is also the scene of Fish’s long sought-after death or return to the water.  The novel is narrated effectively by flashback \"in the seconds it takes to die\" by Fish Lamb, or the 'spiritual' omniscient Fish Lamb, free of his restricting retarded state.

The Four big families of Hong Kong () are an initial group of Chinese families.  Today, the Big Four families and their descendants are Fortune Global 500 companies with multinational corporations and listings from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange.  Along with their European mostly British rivals in colonial Hong Kong, they were responsible for much of the foundations of the territory including its economy, finance, and trade, whilst the British government provided the first codified legal system which until then and in most of China today, was lacking.  The four big families begin with the Chinese surname Li, Ho, Hui and Lo.  Respectively the head of four families are Li Sek-peng (), Robert Ho (), Hui Oi-chow () and Lo Cheung-shiu ().  Today the two families most recognizable by regular Hong Kong citizens are the Li and Ho group descendants. Donald Li (born 1961) is a Chinese actor.

They are chaperon molecules with peptidylprolyl isomerase activity that exists in two families, with different characteristics.  These two families are \"cyclosporin-binding cyclophilins (CyPs)\" and \"FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs)\".  However, there are also large molecules that contain both families on its opposite sides. The Titanoecoidea or titanoecoids are a proposed taxon of araneomorph spiders at the superfamily rank.  The taxon contains two families of spiders Phyxelididae and Titanoecidae.  Although some phylogenetic studies have shown these two families to form a clade, other studies have not, placing Titanoecidae outside the RTA clade while Phyxelididae is placed inside it.  A 2011 classification of spider families leaves both Phyxelididae and Titanoecidae outside the RTA clade as \"unplaced non-Orbiculariae families\".  The status of the group remains unclear as of December 2015 . Fission, in biology, is the division of a single entity into two or more parts and the regeneration of those parts into separate entities resembling the original.

The song was co-written by Swift, alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid.  \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut album (2006).  The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom.  It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings.  He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by.  Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him.  Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar.  Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of \"Rolling Stone\") citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of \"PopMatters\") indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements. \"Picture to Burn\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.

In retrospect, Swift has stated that she has evolved on a personal level and as a songwriter, claiming she processed emotions differently since \"Picture to Burn\".  The song was chosen as a single based on the audience's reaction to it in concert.  Musically, the track is of the country rock genre with prominent usage of guitar, banjo, and drums.

Sonora Santanera is an orchestra playing tropical music from Mexico with over 60 years of history.  The band was founded in 1955 by Carlos Colorado in the state of Tabasco, modeled after an earlier Cuban band called Sonora Matancera.  However, the band created its own style.  In 1960, comic actor Jesús “Palillo” Martínez helped the band play in Mexico City and get a professional record deal under the name of Sonora Santanera.  From that time until 1986, the band changed members, but remained focused on Carlos Colorado, the sole musical arranger for the group.  Colorado died in a bus accident in 1986, causing some members to split off and form another orchestra called Los Santaneros.  The remaining members changed name to Internacional Sonora Santanera.  Since the 1980s, little of the band’s sound changed although members continued to do so.  In the 2000s, more bands appeared using the name of Sonora Santanera as part of their names, leading the orchestra to pursue legal actions and another name change in 2007 to the current name of \"La Única Internacional Sonora Santanera\". Sua Ghin Gnua is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Thailand, formerly known as Siam.  Another name for the game is Tigers and Oxen.  It is a hunt game played on a 5x5 square grid with only orthogonal lines.  One player plays the three tigers, and the other player plays the twelve oxen.  The board is empty in the beginning.  Players first drop their pieces onto the board, and then are able to move them.  The tigers can capture the oxen by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, but the oxen attempt to elude and at the same time hem in the tiger.  Sua Ghin Gnua most resembles the tiger hunt games (or tiger games) such as Bagh-Chal, Rimau-rimau, Main Tapal Empat, Catch the Hare, and Adugo since they all use a 5 x 5 square grid.  But tiger games technically consist of a standard Alquerque board which is a 5 x 5 square grid with several diagonal lines criss-crossing through it which are completely missing in Sua Ghin Gnua.  There are however some variants of Catch the Hare which have missing diagonal lines also.  Another game that resembles Sua Ghin Gnua is from Myanmar called Tiger and Buffaloes which is a hunt game consisting of a 4 x 4 square grid with no diagonal lines.  Myanmar happens to border Thailand geographically so there might be a historical connection between the two games.  Another game from Myanmar is Lay Gwet Kyah that is presumed to be similar to Sua Ghin Gnua.  Sua Ghin Gnua was briefly described by Stewart Culin, in his book \"Chess and Playing Cards: Catalogue of Games and Implements for Divination Exhibited by the United States National Museum in Connection with the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania at the Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia 1895\" (1898).  It's also briefly mentioned by H.J.R. Murray in his book \"A History of Chess\" (1913).  It was also described by R.C. Bell, in his book \"Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations\" (1969). Chunwei () is an ethnonym for the most ancient nomadic tribes that invaded China during legendary times.  A Chinese Classical scholar and the first President of the Imperial Nanking University, Wei Zhao (204–273), commented, identificating the name Chunwei with the name of the Huns: “During the Han (206 BC-220 AD) they (the Huns) were called Xiongnu 匈奴, and the Hunyu 葷粥 is just another name for the same people, and similarly, the Xunyu 獯粥 is just another transcription of Chunwei’s 淳維, their ancestor’s name”.

Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court considered the role of standby counsel in a criminal trial where the defendant conducted his own defense (\"pro se\").

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_36", "context": "Mormonism and Mormon adherents have been subjected to, as well as in a few instances themselves used, significant violence throughout much of the religion's history.  In the early history of the United States, violence was used as a form of control.  Many people of different faiths used violence in order to harass and persecute people who adhered to different religious beliefs.  The members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, especially in its early history, were both the victims and sometimes the perpetrators of violence in much the same way as were the followers of other major religions. Mormons were violently persecuted and pushed from Ohio to Missouri, from Missouri to Illinois and from Illinois, they were pushed west to the Utah Territory.  There were incidents of massacre, home burning and pillaging, followed by the murder of their founder, Joseph Smith.  However, there were also a few notable incidents in which Latter-day Saints perpetrated violence, such as the Mountain Meadows massacre. The Niles Canyon ghost story is the Northern California variation on the vanishing hitchhiker archetype.  There are many different variations of this story depending on whom you ask.  All stories include a girl being involved in some sort of motorized vehicle accident on February 26 (year often changed).  One variation of the story includes a girl being involved in a car crash on Niles Canyon road (off the 680 freeway in Sunol, California) on the way to her prom.  The girl died on impact and to this day is said to haunt Niles Canyon road every February 26.  The tale of the haunting goes that people traveling along Niles Canyon road (now Highway 84) on the night of February 26 will see a normal-looking high school-aged girl walking along the road in a prom dress (many people have said it is white).  People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride.  She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller).  Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear.  Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there.  Today, many people will travel along this treacherous pitch black road in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Niles Canyon ghost. The El Ayyat train disaster happened at 02:00 on the morning of 20 February 2002 in an eleven-carriage passenger train travelling from Cairo to Luxor.  A cooking gas cylinder exploded in the fifth carriage, creating a fire which engulfed seven third-class carriages, reducing them almost to cinders.  The initial number of dead given by officials at the time was 383, all Egyptians.  However, considering that seven carriages were burnt to the ground, and each carriage was packed with at least double the maximum carrying capacity of 150, this number is considered by many people to be a great underestimate.  The dubious nature of the given death toll lies with the absence of a full passenger list; accounting for those missing was almost impossible at the time.  In addition, the fire was so intense and the carriages so badly burned that many corpses had been reduced to ash.  As there was no means of communication between the driver and the rear carriages, the driver did not know of the fire until about two hours after it had begun, resulting in many people, attempting to flee from the overcrowded carriages, jumping to their death.  Some important Egyptians have commentated that the official number of 383 dead is grossly inaccurate and was an attempt to lessen the damage done to the reputation of the government.  Many people consider a number of about 1000 deaths to be more accurate. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have satisfying sex lives.  Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, which in turn has important effects on quality of life.  Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion.  This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication.  More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications.  Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image.  Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm.  People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts.  Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation. Joseph Horn Cloud born 1873 and died September 18, 1920.  His father was Horn Cloud and mother Nest, both parents died at the Wounded Knee Massacre along with two brothers William Horn Cloud (1876-1890), Sherman Horn Cloud (1865-1890) and a niece.  Joseph was a survivor of the massacre as well as his brother Daniel and half brother Dewey Beard [p. 89-95].  Dewey's mother was Yellow Leaf who also died during the massacre.  In the early 1900s a writer named Eli S. Ricker began research for a book he was going to call \"The Final Conflict between the Red Men and the Palefaces.\"  He gathered sources and interviews about conditions and battles on the Plains during the last half of the 1800s.  He recorded the interviews in small note pads known to historians as the \"Ricker Tablets.\"  One such interview was with Joseph telling Ricker what he witnessed at the Wounded Knee Massacre, \"When the shooting began the women ran to the ravine.  The shooting was in every direction.  Soldiers shot into one another... Many of the Indians in the circle were killed.  Many of them mingled with the soldiers behind them, picking up guns from dead soldiers and taking cartridge belts.\" The Seoul National University Hospital massacre (Korean: 서울대학교 부속병원 학살 사건 Hanja: 서울國立大學校附属病院虐殺事件) was a massacre committed by the North Korea's Korean People's Army on 28 June 1950 of 700 to 900 doctors, nurses, inpatient civilians and wounded soldiers at the Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul district of South Korea.  During the First Battle of Seoul, the KPA wiped out one platoon which guarded Seoul National University Hospital on 28 June 1950.  They massacred medical personnel, inpatients and wounded soldiers.  The Korean People's Army shot or buried alive the people.  The civilian victims alone numbered 900.  According to South Korean Ministry of National Defense, the victims included 100 South Korean wounded soldiers. Plenty Horses (\"Tasunka\") (b. 1869) was a Sicangu (Brulé) Lakota from the Rosebud Indian Reservation.  On January 7, 1891, eight days after the Wounded Knee Massacre, he shot and killed Army Lieutenant Edward W. Casey, commandant of the Cheyenne Scouts (designated Troop L, Eighth Cavalry) two miles north of the Stronghold Table in the Badlands of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  Plenty Horses – who was present at the Drexel Mission Fight the day after the Wounded Knee Massacre, was arrested for the murder and his case went to trial.  His defense was he shot and killed Casey as an effort to redeem himself in the eyes of his people after having spent five years at the Carlisle Indian School learning the ways of the white man.  He returned in time to be present on the reservation during the massacre. The Hungerford massacre was a series of random shootings in Hungerford, Berkshire, United Kingdom, on 19 August 1987, when Michael Robert Ryan, an unemployed antique dealer and handyman, fatally shot 16 people, before taking his own life.  The shootings, committed using a handgun and two semi-automatic rifles, occurred at several locations, including a school he had once attended.  A police officer died in the incident, and many people were injured.  15 other people were also shot but survived.  No firm motive for the killings has ever been established, although one psychologist has theorised Ryan's motive for the massacre had been a form of \"anger and contempt for the ordinary life\" around him, which he himself was not a tangible part of. Flying Hawk (Oglala Lakota: \"Čhetáŋ Kiŋyáŋ\" in Standard Lakota Orthography; a/k/a Moses Flying Hawk; March 1854 – December 24, 1931) was an Oglala Lakota warrior, historian, educator and philosopher.  Flying Hawk's life chronicles the history of the Oglala Lakota people through the 19th and early 20th centuries, as he fought to deflect the worst effects of white rule; educate his people and preserve sacred Oglala Lakota land and heritage.  Chief Flying Hawk was a combatant in Red Cloud's War and in nearly all of the fights with the U.S. Army during the Great Sioux War of 1876.  He fought alongside his first cousin Crazy Horse and his brothers Kicking Bear and Black Fox II in the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876, and was present at the death of Crazy Horse in 1877 and the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890.  Chief Flying Hawk was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877.  Chief Flying Hawk is notable in American history for his commentaries and classic accounts of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse and the Wounded Knee Massacre, and of Native American warriors and statesmen from who fought to protect their families, defend the invasion of their lands and preserve their culture.  Chief Flying Hawk was probably the longest standing Wild Wester, traveling for over 30 years throughout the United States and Europe from about 1898 to about 1930.  Chief Flying Hawk was an educator and believed public education was essential to preserve Lakota culture.  He frequently visited public schools for presentations.  Chief Flying Hawk leaves a legacy of Native American philosophy and his winter count covers nearly 150 years of Lakota history. The National Firearms Agreement (NFA), also sometimes called the National Agreement on Firearms, the National Firearms Agreement and Buyback Program, or the Nationwide Agreement on Firearms, was a firearm control law passed in Australia in 1996, in response to the Port Arthur massacre that killed 35 people.  The laws to give effect to the Agreement were passed by Australian State governments only 12 days after the Port Arthur massacre.", "com_question": "How many people were wounded in the massacre?

The song was written by Ciara, along with its two producers Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and Kenneth \"Soundz\" Coby for her fourth studio album, \"Basic Instinct\" (2010).  \"Gimmie Dat\" is an uptempo dance song, featuring speedy, kinetic beats and a sensual-breathy tone.  The song has been compared to her previous hip hop-flavored dance songs, \"Goodies\", and \"Work\", and has also been compared to Missy Elliott's \"Work It\".  \"Gimmie Dat\" was released as the third single from \"Basic Instinct\" on October 15, 2010.  In some countries, the song was released alongside \"Speechless\", as a dual single. \"Who Says\" is a song performed by American band Selena Gomez & the Scene.  Priscilla Renea wrote the song with Emanuel Kiriakou, who produced the track.  The song was released in March 2011, as the lead single from the band's third album, \"When the Sun Goes Down\" (2011).  According to Gomez, the song was intended to inspire people, and fire back at the \"haters\", particularly those involved in cyberbullying.  \"Who Says\" marks a distinct departure in sound for the band, as it has an acoustic and organic feel, compared to their dance-pop and club-oriented previous singles. Sayyid Jamal al-Din \"Va'iz\" Esfahani (Persian: سید جمال‌الدین واعظ اصفهانی‎ ‎ ; also known as Seyed Jamal Vaez [\"The Preacher\"], 1862–1908) was a popular pro-constitutional preacher and writer in Iran.  He was one of the founders of a constitutional movement in Isfahan in 1890s.  He wrote for the reformist newspapers - especially for \"Al Jamal\".  He wrote mostly about the economy and the financial autonomy of Persia, which he compared it to jihad. Amoghavarsha I (also known as Amoghavarsha Nrupathunga I ) (800–878 CE) was a Rashtrakuta emperor, the greatest ruler of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, and one of the great emperors of India.  His reign of 64 years is one of the longest precisely dated monarchical reigns on record.  Many Kannada and Sanskrit scholars prospered during his rule, including the great Indian mathematician Mahaviracharya who wrote \"Ganita-sara-samgraha\", Jinasena, Virasena, Shakatayan and Sri Vijaya (a Kannada language theorist).  Amoghavarsha I was an accomplished poet and scholar.  He wrote (or co-authored) the \"Kavirajamarga\", the earliest extant literary work in Kannada, and \"Prashnottara Ratnamalika\", a religious work in Sanskrit.  During his rule he held such titles as \"Nrupathunga\", \"Atishadhavala\", \"Veeranarayana\", \"Rattamarthanda\" and \"Srivallabha\".  He moved the Rashtrakuta regal capital from Mayurkhandi in the Bidar district to Manyakheta in the Gulbarga district in the modern Karnataka state.  He is said to have built the regal city to \"match that of Lord Indra\".  The capital city was planned to include elaborately designed buildings for the royalty using the finest of workmanship.  The Arab traveler Sulaiman described Amoghavarsha as one of the four great kings of the world.  Sulaiman also wrote that Amoghavarsha respected Muslims and that he allowed the construction of mosques in his cities.  For his religious temperament, his interest in the fine arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, historian Panchamukhi has compared him to the legendary emperor Ashoka and given him the honorific \"Ashoka of the South\".  Amoghavarsha seems to have entertained the highest admiration for the language, literature and culture of the Kannada people as testified to in the text Kavirajamarga.

Gee opened for vocalist Tony Bennett and his orchestra after being the featured vocalist on various albums throughout her teen years.  She released her debut album \"Hidden Treasure\" with Universal Music in 2007, while living in Poland.  Her single from the album, \"For Life\", was voted unanimous winner of Piosenka dla Europy, the Polish final for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest.  Tamara and her song \"For Life\" was the first Polish entry in history to qualify for the Eurovision final since the new rules were designed in the contest and a French television commentator compared Gee's performance to Celine Dion.  A portion of Gee's Eurovision performance was shown on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on \"The World's Got Talent\" episode with Simon Cowell where Gee sang with former participants Celine Dion, ABBA and Julio Iglesias.  In 2007 Gee co-wrote and performed \"Fate\" on DJ Schiller's album \"Sehnsucht\".  The album went triple platinum and was nominated for a Grammy.

In \"Boy Meets Girl\", Harris describes his personal experiences courting the woman he eventually married.  The book argues that psychological pain and trauma can result from entering an intimate relationship before one is ready, either emotionally or financially, to commit to being the other person's life partner.  Margaret and Dwight Peterson wrote an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story\" in which they criticized \"Boy Meets Girl\", among other books.  In this essay, the Petersons expressed \"how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage.\"  Harris has written several other books, including \"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\", \"Sex Is Not the Problem (Lust Is)\", and \"Stop Dating the Church\".  \"Boy Meets Girl\" did not receive as much critical attention as \"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\".  Leah Andrews of the \"Lewiston Morning Tribune\" compared \"Boy Meets Girl\" to Eric and Leslie Ludy's \"When God Writes Your Love Story\", suggesting that both texts are popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating.  Andrew Dalton of the Legion of Christ wrote that he was partway through reading Anthony Bannon's \"Peter on the Shore\" when he became distracted with \"Boy Meets Girl\".  In 2000, Rebecca St. James anticipated using her song \"Wait for Me\" to promote \"Boy Meets Girl\". \"Lucky Day\" is a song by British recording artist Nicola Roberts.  It was released on September 18, 2011 under label Polydor Records as the second single from Roberts debut album \"Cinderella's Eyes\".  The song was written by Roberts and was produced by Canadian electropop group Dragonette.  \"Lucky Day\" is an upbeat pop song featuring synths; lyrically the song talks of a boy not succumbing to advances—but doing so eventually—although Roberts stated the concept relates to all aspects of life and luckiness.  Roberts' vocals have been compared to that of Liza Minnelli and the track has been compared to the music of David Guetta and the Katy Perry track \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\". Daytrotter is a commercial website for the recording studio Horseshack, which hosts recording sessions with many popular and typically up-and-coming indie music acts, although it works with local bands in the Illinois area as well.

Two songs on this compilation album are edited compared to the original releases: \"We've Got Tonight\" is the single edit, which is about one minute shorter than the album version, and \"Katmandu\" is a newly edited version which omits the second verse, making the song also about one minute shorter compared to the original album version.  In the US it was certified gold and platinum in June 2013 by the RIAA. \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" is a country song performed by American singers Billy Ray Cyrus and Miley Cyrus.  It was released as the lead single from \"Home at Last\", Billy Ray Cyrus' tenth studio album.  The song is a soft country ballad with some use of pop and soft rock elements.  The song has received different interpretations, although, in actuality, Cyrus wrote the song several years before its release when his middle daughter, Miley, moved to Los Angeles in order to pursue an acting career with an audition for the Disney Channel Original Series \"Hannah Montana\".  \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" received critical praise, with reviewers complimenting its lyrical content.  It also reached positive commercial responses for Cyrus, compared to his downfall in previous years.  Peaking at number 85 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, it became Cyrus' first entry on the chart since \"You Won't Be Lonely Now\" (2000).", "com_question": "Who wrote the song \"Why I'm Here\" is compared to?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_41", "context": "The last of the \"Trygg\" class of Royal Norwegian Navy torpedo boats was HNoMS \"Stegg\".  Her sister ships were \"Trygg\" and \"Snøgg\".  The \"Trygg\" class vessels were the only additions to the Norwegian fleet of torpedo boats between the First and the Second World Wars.  At the outbreak of the Second World War the \"Trygg\" class was mobilised together with eight 2.  class and six 1.  class torpedo boats. A missile boat or missile cutter is a small fast warship armed with anti-ship missiles. Being smaller than other warships such as destroyers and frigates, missile boats are popular with nations interested in forming a navy at lower cost.  They are similar in concept to the torpedo boats of World War II; in fact, the first missile boats were modified torpedo boats with the torpedo tubes replaced by missile tubes. The scuttling of the German fleet took place at the Royal Navy's base at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, after the First World War.  The High Seas Fleet was interned there under the terms of the Armistice whilst negotiations took place over the fate of the ships.  Fearing that all of the ships would be seized and divided amongst the allied powers, the German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, decided to scuttle the fleet. The Schichau class were torpedo boats built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1885 and 1891.  A total of 22 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies; nine by Seearsenal Pola, six by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, and the remaining seven boats were built by Schichau-Werke.  The class was one of the first torpedo boat classes built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and they were initially powered by steam from a single locomotive boiler.  The entire class was reconstructed between 1900 and 1910, when they received two Yarrow boilers and a second funnel.  Ten of the class were converted to minesweepers between 1911 and 1913, and apart from one that was discarded in 1911, all boats saw active service as part of local defence forces for Adriatic naval bases during World War I, with one being lost in the early days of the war.  The remaining nine torpedo boats were also converted to minesweepers in 1917, although five still carried torpedoes.  After the war, sixteen were allocated to Italy and four were allocated to the navy of the newly created Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia).  Except for one of the Yugoslav boats which was retained as a training vessel, all of the boats had been discarded and broken up by 1925.  After capture during the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia the remaining boat saw service with the Italians then the Germans during World War II.  She was lost in German hands sometime after September 1943. The \"Rapp\"-class torpedo boats were a class of six torpedo boats built in Norway for the Royal Norwegian Navy from 1952 to 1956.  They were the first Norwegian-built torpedo boats after World War II, and were designed in light of experience from operations in this war.  The boats were slightly larger than the Elco class. The \"König\" class was a group of four battleships built for the German \"Kaiserliche Marine\" on the eve of World War I.  The class was composed of \"König\" , \"Grosser Kurfürst\" , \"Markgraf\" , and \"Kronprinz\" .  The most powerful warships of the German High Seas Fleet at the outbreak of war in 1914, the class operated as a unit throughout World War I—the V Division of the III Battle Squadron.  The ships took part in a number of fleet operations during the war, including the Battle of Jutland, where they acted as the vanguard of the German line.  They survived the war and were interned at Scapa Flow in November 1918.  All four ships were scuttled on 21 June 1919 when Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the sinking of the entire High Seas Fleet. In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers.  They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defence against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these \"torpedo boat destroyers\" (TBDs) were \"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats.\"  Although the term \"destroyer\" had been used interchangeably with \"TBD\" and \"torpedo boat destroyer\" by navies since 1892, the term \"torpedo boat destroyer\" had been generally shortened to simply \"destroyer\" by nearly all navies by the First World War. Ludwig von Reuter (9 February 1869 – 18 December 1943) was a German admiral during World War I who commanded the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet when it was interned at Scapa Flow at the end of the war.  On 21 June 1919 he ordered the scuttling of the fleet to prevent the British from seizing the ships. The A\"-class torpedo boats were a class of German single-funnelled torpedo boat/light destroyer designed by the Reichsmarineamt for operations off the coast of occupied Flanders in the First World War.  The A designation was to avoid confusion with older classes and designs.  They were known as \"coastal torpedo boats\" (German: Küstentorpedoboote\") to differentiate from larger, ocean-going torpedo boats. Admiral Sir Sydney Robert Fremantle, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (16 November 1867 – 29 April 1958) was an officer of the Royal Navy, who served during the Victorian era and had risen to the rank of rear-admiral by the outbreak of the First World War.  He played a role in developing fleet communications and signalling methods prior to the war, but was hampered in effectively implementing them due to the disruption caused by the conflict.  He had an active seagoing career during the war, commanding several of the cruiser squadrons, and later taking command of the British fleet in the Aegean.  Promoted to vice-admiral after the end of the war and given command of the First Battle Squadron, Fremantle oversaw the interned German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow, and was away on exercises when the sailors began to scuttle their ships in June 1919.  He attempted to salvage what he could, later accusing the German commander, Vice-Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, of a shameful breach of honour.  Fremantle rose to full admiral and commanded the naval base at Portsmouth, retiring in 1928.  He wrote his memoirs, publishing them after the Second World War, and donated many of his papers to institutions before his death in 1958.", "com_question": "What decision did Admiral Ludwig von Reuter make regarding the G101-class torpedo boats that were captured during the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia?

During the period of the \"low intensity warfare\", the IFP was the sole ruling party of the Bantustan KwaZulu government, and worked in collaboration with the apartheid government, whereas the ANC was operating underground; as a result the IFP had an upper hand over the ANC when it came to the warfare.  But post apartheid, the African National Congress (ANC) became the governing party in South Africa whereas the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) became one of the opposition parties in the South African parliament, as a result the ANC gained the upper hand over the IFP in the remaining years of the warfare as the ANC was in control of the state apparatus by virtue of being the governing party.  The IFP leadership denied its involvement in sanctioning and orchestrating political violence in the furtherance of its political objectives during the period of the \"low intensity warfare\" in South Africa.

Umkhonto we Sizwe, the militant wing of the African National Congress, made its first sabotage attacks in 1961, and Nelson Mandela traveled to Ethiopia to rally support for Umkhonto and justify the attacks.  Nelson Mandela was sentenced to jail for 5 years upon returning to South Africa for illegally leaving the country.  The international sporting community also showed its displeasure with the government's laws.  FIFA suspended South Africa in 1962 for fielding an exclusively-white South African national football team, forcing South African football authorities to add black players to the team.  The government, in turn strengthened methods of enforcing Apartheid, and the Robben Island prison was made a political prison in 1962. Have You Heard from Johannesburg is a series of seven documentary films, with a total runtime of 8.5 hours, covering the 45-year struggle of the global anti-apartheid movement against South Africa's apartheid system and its international supporters who considered them an ally in the Cold War.  The combined films have an epic scope, spanning most of the globe over half a century.  Beginning with the very first session of the United Nations, and ending in 1990 – when, after 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela, the best known leader of the African National Congress toured the world, a free man.  Produced and directed by Connie Field, it includes other events such as the Sharpeville massacre, the Soweto uprising, the murder of Steve Biko, and covers the role of some people less well-known outside South Africa than Nelson Mandela, such as African National Congress leader Oliver Tambo.  The title comes from the lyrics of the Gil Scott-Heron song “Johannesburg”. 1990 in South Africa saw the official start of the process of ending Apartheid.  President of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk announced plans to end apartheid.  President De Klerk unbanned organisations that were banned by the government including the African National Congress, the South African Communist Party and the Pan Africanist Congress.  The African National Congress' armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, suspends its armed activity within South Africa.  Political prisoners including Nelson Mandela were released.  Nelson Mandela met ANC leader Oliver Tambo for the first time in 28 years at a meeting in Sweden.  Mandela also traveled to England to thank the people for their support in the campaign to free him.  South Africa withdrew its troops from Namibia, which was granted independence.  1990 also saw marches in support and against the formation of a new post-Apartheid South Africa.

On his death in 1839, both baronies became extinct.  Lord St Helens was the son of William Fitzherbert, Member of Parliament for Derby, and a younger brother of Sir William Fitzherbert, 1st Baronet. Mrs. Fitzherbert, also known as Princess Fitz and A Court Secret, is a rarely seen 1947 British historical drama film directed by Montgomery Tully and starring Peter Graves, Joyce Howard and Leslie Banks.  It depicts the relationship between George IV and Maria Fitzherbert. William Stourton, 18th Baron Stourton (1776–1846) was a Roman Catholic English peer.  He is chiefly remembered for the private memoirs of his relative Maria Fitzherbert, the secret wife of King George IV, which she dictated to him, and which formed the basis for her first biography, published by his brother Charles Langdale in 1856. St John the Baptist's Church is a Roman Catholic church in the Kemptown area of the English city of Brighton and Hove.  It was the first Roman Catholic church built in Brighton after the process of Catholic Emancipation in the early 19th century removed restrictions on Catholic worship.  Located on Bristol Road, a main road east of the city centre, it is one of 11 Catholic churches in Brighton and Hove.  The Classical-style building, which was funded by Maria Fitzherbert and completed in 1835, has been listed at Grade II* by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance. Maria Enriquez de Luna (1474 – 1539) was the wife of Juan (Giovanni) Borgia, second Duke of Gandia.  She was a first cousin of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile, and therefore of the House of Trastamara.  She married Juan somewhere between 1493-1494, and together, they had three children: twins Juan de Borja y Enriquez (known as Juan Borgia), who became the 3rd Duke of Gandía, and Francisca de Jesus Borja, who became a nun at a convent in Valladolid.  The younger Juan was the father of Saint Francis Borgia.  Their third child, Isabel de Borja y Enriquez, was born after her father was killed.  She grew up to be abbess of Santa Clara in Gandia.  In personality, Maria was very intelligent, devout, financially shrewd, and devoted to her husband and children, in contrast to her husband, who was regarded by many as a womanizer, a gambler, a drunkard, and an incompetent general. Maria of Vitebsk (died before 1349) was the first wife of Algirdas, future Grand Duke of Lithuania (marriage took place around 1318).  Very little is known about her life.  The only child of a Russian prince Yaroslav, Maria was the only heir to the Principality of Vitebsk.  After her father's death ca. 1345, Vitebsk fell permanently under control of Algirdas and other Gediminids.  Maria gave birth to five sons, all of whom grew up while Algirdas was still only a regional duke in Slavic lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  All five sons were baptized in Orthodox rite and ruled Russian lands giving rise to prominent clans of Russian dukes (Trubetskoy family from Demetrius I Starshy, Czartoryski family from Constantine, Sanguszko family from Fiodor, Belsky and Olelkovich families from Valdimir).  After Maria's death, Algirdas married another Russian princess, Uliana of Tver.  After Algirdas' death, eldest sons of Maria and Uliana battled over succession rights. Steine House is the former residence of Maria Fitzherbert, mistress and wife of the Prince Regent, in the centre of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove.  Designed in 1804 by William Porden, who was responsible for many buildings on the Prince's Royal Pavilion estate, it was used by Fitzherbert until her death 33 years later.  Regular rebuilding has affected the appearance of the house since 1805, when it was damaged by a storm; more changes took place in 1884, when the YMCA bought it, and the building was \"cruelly treated\" by a refronting and extension in 1927.  The YMCA continue to use the building, on Brighton's Old Steine next to Marlborough House, as a 65-person hostel.  The extensive alterations have reduced its architectural importance, but the building has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its historical connections. Charles Langdale (formerly Stourton); 19 September 1787 – 1 December 1868) was a British politician, Roman Catholic layman, and biographer.  He served as Whig Member of Parliament, wrote the memoirs of Maria Fitzherbert, and was a leading Roman Catholic figure during the 19th century. Andrés de Santa Maria Hurtado was born in Bogotá, Colombia on December 16, 1860.  He was the third son of Andrés de Santa Maria Rovira and Manuela Hurtado.  He belonged to a well off family that was politically connected.  Both his grandfather and his father worked for several years in high official positions for the Colombian government.  In 1862, when he was two years old, his parents took him to Europe.  The family lived in London until 1869 when they moved to Brussels.  In 1878, his father obtained a position at the Colombian Embassy in France and his family settled in Paris.  Santa Maria's desire to be a painter faced the strong opposition of his parents who forced him to follow a career in finances.  For a time, he worked as a banker, but at the death of his father in 1882, he was finally able to study painting. Maria Anne Fitzherbert (\"née\" Smythe, previously Weld; 26 July 1756 – 27 March 1837) was a longtime companion of the future King George IV of the United Kingdom with whom she secretly contracted a marriage that was invalid under English civil law before his accession to the throne.  Though Fitzherbert had been disinherited by her first husband, her nephew-in-law (Cardinal Weld) persuaded Pope Pius VII to declare the marriage sacramentally valid.", "com_question": "What title did Maria Fitzherbert's husband hold after his father's death?

Its full title is \"Ludwig van Beethovens Werke: vollständige kritisch durchgesehene überall berechtige Ausgabe\" (which roughly translated means \"Ludwig van Beethoven's Works: complete, critical, thoroughly revised, authorized edition\").  It was published between 1862 and 1865, with a supplementary volume appearing in 1888. The Beethoven Project Trio is an American piano trio that was formed in Chicago in 2008.

John von Rhein, music critic of the Chicago Tribune, wrote about the trio's first concert that \"for musicians who had never worked together as a trio before, pianist George Lepauw, violinist Sang Mee Lee and cellist Wendy Warner made a splendid ensemble, playing with finely judged balance, evenness of sound and unanimity of style [...] Lepauw, Lee and Warner ended their program with Beethoven’s familiar “Archduke” Trio, a masterpiece that drew fully on their individual and collective abilities.

It is the first Trans-Siberian Orchestra album that does not feature Christmas themes.  The original cover art was created by Edgar Jerins, and re-issued cover art was created by Greg Hildebrandt.

The soundtrack is an arrangement of fragments of Beethoven's works, modified as if heard by the deaf composer himself; it is distinct from Kagel's 1970 composition \"Ludwig van\".  Prominent contemporary artists including Dieter Roth, Stefan Wewerka (), Robert Filliou, and Joseph Beuys were involved in the design.  According to \"Gramophone\", \"at first it’s a laugh a minute ... then Kagel's film turns dark\". Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder, also Ludovicus van Beethoven and Lodewijk van Beethoven (January 5, 1712 – December 24, 1773) was a professional singer and music director, best known as the grandfather of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. Ludwig van Beethoven's Bagatelles, Op. 126, dedicated to his brother Johann van Beethoven, were published late in his career, in the year 1825.  A bagatelle, in Beethoven's usage, is a kind of brief character piece. Wilhelm von Lenz (born 20 May 1809 in Riga - died 7 January 1883 in Saint Petersburg) was a Baltic German Russian official and writer.  Wilhelm von Lenz was a friend of many mid-century Romantic composers, including Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin and Hector Berlioz, Lenz's most important and influential work was an early biography of the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven, entitled \"Beethoven et ses trois styles\" (1855), written in response to the disparagement of Beethoven by Alexander Ulybyshev in his \"Nouvelle biographie de Mozart\" (1843).  Lenz promoted the idea (already suggested by earlier figures such as François-Joseph Fétis) that Beethoven's musical style be divided into three characteristic periods.  Lenz's periodisation, with minor changes, is still widely used today by musicologists in discussing Beethoven's compositions. The Beethoven concert of 22 December 1808 was a benefit concert held for Ludwig van Beethoven at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna that featured the public premieres of Beethoven's Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, the Fourth Piano Concerto and the Choral Fantasy.  This concert, then called an \"Akademie\", occurred in a very cold hall and was approximately four hours duration.  Its featured performers were an orchestra, chorus, vocal soloists, and the composer as piano soloist.  Beethoven biographer Barry Cooper refers to the concert, in terms of its content, as the \"most remarkable\" of Beethoven's career.", "com_question": "Where was Beethoven's only opera first performed?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_59", "context": "Wachau is one of Austria's most established and notable wine regions, specializing in dry wines made from Riesling and Grüner Veltliner.  Located in Lower Austria along the Danube, west of Vienna and Krems an der Donau, it is one of the westernmost wine producing regions in Austria with only a few scattered plantings in Tyrol being further west.  While most of Austria follows a wine classification systems based on ripeness and harvest must weight that parallels the German wine classification system, Wachau wines have a unique classification system.  The three classification levels for Wachau wine include \"Steinfeder\" for wines up to 11.5% alcohol level, \"Federspiel\" for wines between 11.5–12.5% and \"Smaragd\" that must have a minimum of 12.5% alcohol level.  Despite its renown, the Wachau is a small wine region that usually accounts for only around 3% of Austria's wine production. Panicum repens is a species of grass known by many common names, including torpedograss, creeping panic, panic rampant, couch panicum, wainaku grass, quack grass, dog-tooth grass, and bullet grass.  Its exact native range is obscure.  Sources suggest that the grass is native to \"Africa and/or Asia\", \"Europe or Australia\", \"Eurasia\", \"Australia\", \"Europe, Asia, and Africa\", or other specific regions, including the Mediterranean, Israel, and Argentina.  It is present in many places as an introduced species and often a noxious weed.  It has been called \"one of the world's worst weeds.\" The Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf classification system is an evolving system of classification of vegetation types, plant communities, or floristic characterization.  It was first developed in 1995 by John O. Sawyer and Todd Keeler-Wolf for the California Native Plant Society, in the mission to classify all vegetation in California.  Particular attention was paid to recognizing rare types that were \"lumped\" into general categories in previous systems, such as the Munz and Keck classification system, Chetham and Haller classification system, and Holland classification system.  It uses constantly updated quantitative measurements of both species diversity and cover to define its types.  It intended to be evolving and to continue to be refined. Para-archery classification is the classification system for para-archery used to create a level playing field for archers with a different range of disabilities.  Governance in the sport is through the International Archery Federation.  Early classification systems for the sport were created during the 1940s and based on medical classification.  This has subsequently changed to a functional mobility classification with the exception of blind archery. In 1984, the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study set up a working party, now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group, to produce a consensus classification of the cactus family, down to the level of genus.  Their classification has been used as the basis for systems published since the mid-1990s.  Treatments in the 21st century have generally divided the family into around 125–130 genera and 1,400–1,500 species, which are then arranged in a number of tribes and subfamilies.  However, subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that a very high proportion of the higher taxa (genera, tribes and subfamilies) are not monophyletic, i.e. they do not contain all of the descendants of a common ancestor.  , the internal classification of the family Cactaceae remained uncertain and subject to change.  A classification incorporating many of the insights from the molecular studies was produced by Nyffeler and Eggli in 2010. Panicum amarum is a species of grass known by the common name bitter panicum.  It is native to North America, where it is found in coastal regions along the East Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and into northeastern Mexico.  It also occurs in The Bahamas and in Cuba. Panicum dichotomiflorum, known by the common names fall panicgrass, autumn millet (Britain and Ireland), and fall panicum is a species of Poaceae \"true grass\".  It is native to much of the eastern United States and parts of Canada, and it can be found in the Western United States through California.  It may be an introduced species in some western climates.  It grows in many types of habitat, including disturbed areas and chaparral habitats. \"Panicum mosaic virus\" (PMV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA viral pathogen that infects plant species in the Panicoid tribe of the grass family \"Poaceae\".  The pathogen was first identified in Kansas in 1953 and most commonly causes disease on select cultivars of turf grass, switchgrass, and millet.  The disease most commonly associated with the panicum mosaic virus pathogen is St. Augustine Decline Syndrome, which infects species of turf grass and causes chlorotic mottling.  In addition to St. Augustine Decline, panicum mosaic virus is responsible for chlorotic streaking and mild green mosaicking in select cultivars of switchgrass and millet. The European Union uses a classification for subnational territory called \"Nomenclature des Unites Territriales Statistques\" (commonly abbreviated as NUTS).  The NUTS 1 classification is applied to a group of regions, NUTS 2 for regions and NUTS 3 as subdivisions of regions.  There are also two levels (NUTS 4 and 5) which relate to local administrative unit levels.  Countries agree a NUTS classification with the European Commission.  Geddes notes that NUTS level 2 is \"particularly important\", because they often exist as territorial-government divisions and are used for regional policies by countries.  NUTS 1 typically has a population of 3-7 million; NUTS 2 0.8-3 million; and NUTS 3 150,000-800,000.  As of 2015, there are 98 regions at NUTS 1 level, 276 regions at NUTS 2 level and 1,342 regions at NUTS 3 level \"(as a result, statistics at the NUTS level 3 are found as an external link to this article)\".  The EU is based on the classification of NUTS 2 regions as: less developed regions, transition regions and more developed regions. Coleataenia is a grass genus in the Paniceae tribe of the Poaceae.  Until recently this genus was part of \"Panicum\".  In 2010, Zuloaga, Scataglini, & Morrone proposed the transfer of the \"Panicum\" sections \"Agrostoidea\" and \"Tenera\" to the new genus, \"Sorengia\".  However, that same year, because one of the new species' synonyms was in the valid \"Coleataenia\" genus, Robert J. Soreng determined that \"Sorengia\" was not a valid name for the new genus and re-published it as \"Coleataenia\".", "com_question": "What are the classification levels for Panicum and Pereskia species? How do these levels differ?", "com_reference": "The classification levels for Panicum species typically involve differentiating based on characteristics such as their geographic origin, common names, and potential impact as a noxious weed.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_60", "context": "The Adoration of the Magi or Adoration of the Kings is the name traditionally given to the subject in the Nativity of Jesus in art in which the three Magi, represented as kings, especially in the West, having found Jesus by following a star, lay before him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and worship him.  It is related in the Bible by : \"On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage.  Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another path\". The Master of the Khanenko Adoration was a Flemish painter active at the end of the fifteenth century.  His style is influenced by those of Hugo van der Goes, Hans Memling, and Robert Campin; additionally, echoes of the work of Joachim Patinir and Gerard David may be seen in some of his paintings.  His name is derived from an \"Adoration of the Magi\", now in the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kiev, that once belonged to the Khanenko collection.  Also ascribed to him are a \"Madonna and Child\" in Stuttgart and an \"Adoration of the Magi\" in Saint-Omer, although both attributions have been disputed. The Adoration of the Kings is a large oil-on-oak painting by Jan Gossaert (born Jean Gossart, also known as Jan Mabuse), dated to 1510–15, depicting the Adoration of the Magi.  Although Gossaert's name is signed on the border of Balthazar's richly embroidered headdress, and on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned attendant, the painting was occasionally attributed to Albrecht Dürer in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In 2010, Ainsworth suggested that the work was a collaboration between Gossaert and Gerard David. The Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi was a Netherlandish painter active between c. 1475 – 1500 whose identity is now lost.  He is thought to have originated from the southern Netherlands and is known for his vibrant colourisation in panels depicting scenes from the infancy of Christ, he is thought to have been a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden, and is named after a copy of the \"Adoration of the Magi\" panel from that painter's \"St Columba Altarpiece\".  Although the Magi became a popular topic for northern painters in the second half of the 15th century and the Columba altarpiece was widely copied, the master is associated with van der Weyden's workshop because the copy is so close, it is believed he must have had access to a reproduction of the underdrawing. The Adoration of the Golden Calf is a painting by Nicolas Poussin, produced between 1633 and 1634.  It depicts the adoration of the golden calf by the Israelites, from chapter 32 of the Book of Exodus.  It was made as part of a pair of paintings (the other being \"The Crossing of the Red Sea\") commissioned by Amadeo dal Pozzo, Marchese di Voghera of Turin, a cousin to Cassiano dal Pozzo, Poussin's main sponsor in Rome.  By 1685 the pair had passed to the Chevalier de Lorraine and in 1710 they were bought by Benigne de Ragois de Bretonvillers.  In 1741 they were bought from Samuel by Sir Jacob Bouverie, whose son William became the first Earl of Radnor.  The Earls of Radnor owned the pair from then until 1945, when it was split for the first time and \"The Adoration of the Golden Calf\" bought by the National Gallery in London for £10,000, half of which was contributed by the Art Fund.  (\"The Crossing of the Red Sea\" was bought in the same 1945 sale by the National Gallery of Victoria.)  It now hangs in Room 19 of the National Gallery, where it and Poussin's \"The Adoration of the Shepherds\" were vandalised with red spray paint on 17 July 2011. Nativity is a 1420 panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Robert Campin.  The work is noted for distilling three episodes from the life of Christ into a single panel, rather than presenting them in triptych format.  The scenes are, from left to right, the birth of Christ, the Adoration of the Magi and the adoration of the shepherds.  The painting is harshly realistic; the Child Jesus and his parents are shown in poverty; the figures crowd within a single space shared with animals, in a room with a thatched roof with a hole and broken-down walls.  In this Campin abandons the traditional narrative. The Adoration of the Magi is an oil painting on wood panel by Netherlandish artist Hieronymus Bosch, executed around 1475.  It is housed in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, US.  A prominent feature of this painting is the strong perspective effect and also the copious use of gold leaf which is not very typical for Bosch.  The pigments employed are red lake, azurite, lead-tin-yellow and ochres. The Adoration of the Magi is an early painting by Leonardo da Vinci.  Leonardo was given the commission by the Augustinian monks of San Donato a Scopeto in Florence, but departed for Milan the following year, leaving the painting unfinished.  It has been in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since 1670. The Adoration of the Kings is an oil-on-panel painting of the Adoration of the Magi by the Flemish renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1564, and now in the National Gallery, London. The Adoration of the Magi is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, dating from 1475 or 1476, early in his career.  The work is on display at the Uffizi in Florence.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_61", "context": "The list of Florida hurricanes from 1950 to 1974 encompasses 85 Atlantic tropical or subtropical cyclones that affected the U.S. state of Florida.  Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in about $7.04 billion (2017 USD) in damage, primarily from Hurricanes Donna and Dora.  Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were directly responsible for 93 fatalities during the period, as well as responsible for 23 indirect deaths.  Several tropical cyclones produced over 20 inches (500 mm) of rainfall in the state, including Hurricane Easy which is the highest total during the time period.  The 1969 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 8 systems.  The 1954 and 1967 seasons were the only years during the time period in which a storm did not affect the state. Human population change is the difference between the size of the population from the beginning to the end of a certain time period.  In other words, population change refers to change in the number of people during a specific time period.  As a whole,the world population has not been stable; it has increased manifold.  Due to this constant changing population, the subject of demographics, the statistics of how many people there are in a given population, was created.  Demography can also be defined as the study of populations, and the factors that cause the most amount of population growth or decline.  The main measurements of demography include: birth rates, death rates, sex ratios, life expectancy, and migration rates.  All of these measures are found by a series of surveys and censuses conducted over a time period in order to compare how the population is changing.  Other ways to measure population demographics include the use of historical maps, aerial photographs, and census statistics.  One of the reasons why demographers use statistics about population change is because of the social and demographic transformations that the world experiences; significant challenges for the government and businesses will take effect depending on the degree of the population change. The list of Florida hurricanes from 1900 to 1949 encompasses 108 Atlantic tropical cyclones that affected the U.S. state of Florida.  Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in about $4 billion (2008 USD) in damage.  Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were directly responsible for about 3,550 fatalities during the time period, most of which from the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane.  The 1947 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 6 systems.  The 1905, 1908, 1913, 1927, 1931, 1942, and 1943 seasons were the only years during the time period in which a storm did not affect the Floridian coasts. The temporal mean is the arithmetic mean of a series of values over a time period.  Assuming equidistant measuring or sampling times, it can be computed as the sum of the values over a period divided by the number of values.  A simple moving average can be considered to be a sequence of temporal means over periods of equal duration.  (If the time variable is continuous, the average value during the time period is the integral over the period divided by the length of the duration of the period.) In emergency medicine, the golden hour (also known as golden time) refers to a time period lasting for one hour, or less, following traumatic injury being sustained by a casualty or medical emergency, during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death.  It is well established that the patient's chances of survival are greatest if they receive care within a short period of time after a severe injury; however, there is no evidence to suggest that survival rates drop off after 60 minutes.  Some have come to use the term to refer to the core principle of rapid intervention in trauma cases, rather than the narrow meaning of a critical one-hour time period. In the history of European art music, the term \"common practice period\" refers to the era between the formation and the dissolution of the tonal system.  Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900.  While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution.  Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled \"common practice\" (for example, Sonata Form).  Thus, the dates 1650–1900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context.  The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis. The Time of Troubles, also known as the Arrival, Godswar, and Avatar Crisis, is a fictional time period in the chronology of the \"Forgotten Realms\" campaign setting of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" fantasy role playing game.  Taking place during the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, the Time of Troubles was a cataclysmic period during which the gods of Faerûn were forced to walk the earth in their mortal avatar forms.  However, unlike when a god usually sends an avatar and its true form resides usually on one of the Outer Planes, the gods were all demoted and this was the only form they had at the time, making them very vulnerable.  Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles, and a handful of mortals rose to divinity. Real time within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them.  For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time.  If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning.  This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision.  In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time.  In other stories, such as the daily comic strip \"For Better or For Worse\", each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time. An integrating ADC is a type of analog-to-digital converter that converts an unknown input voltage into a digital representation through the use of an integrator.  In its basic implementation, the dual-slope converter, the unknown input voltage is applied to the input of the integrator and allowed to ramp for a fixed time period (the run-up period).  Then a known reference voltage of opposite polarity is applied to the integrator and is allowed to ramp until the integrator output returns to zero (the run-down period).  The input voltage is computed as a function of the reference voltage, the constant run-up time period, and the measured run-down time period.  The run-down time measurement is usually made in units of the converter's clock, so longer integration times allow for higher resolutions.  Likewise, the speed of the converter can be improved by sacrificing resolution. In cognitive psychology, the telescoping effect (or telescoping bias) refers to the temporal displacement of an event whereby people perceive recent events as being more remote than they are and distant events as being more recent than they are.  The former is known as backward telescoping or time expansion, and the latter as is known as forward telescoping.  Three years is approximately the time frame in which events switch from being displaced backward in time to forward in time, with events occurring three years in the past being equally likely to be reported with forward telescoping bias as with backward telescoping bias.  Although telescoping occurs in both the forward and backward directions, in general the effect is to increase the number of events reported too recently.  This net effect in the forward direction is because of forces that impair memory, such as lack of salience, also impair time perception.  Telescoping leads to an over reporting of the frequency of events.  This over reporting is because participants include events beyond the period, either events that are too recent for the target time period (backward telescoping) or events that are too old for the target time period (forward telescoping).", "com_question": "In what fictional time period did Diana Korner's character appear?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_62", "context": "Rural Canada has many faces and many dimensions (social, cultural, economic, etc.) but the common element of most conceptualizations of \"rural\" is the spatial dimension.  Rural is primarily low population density, small population size, and distance from high population density and big size.  Not surprisingly, the prevailing definitions of “rural” (in Canada as in most countries) emphasize this spatial dimension.  Rural Canada is usually defined by measures of population density, population size and distance from major agglomerations. The forest dormouse (\"Dryomys nitedula\") is a species of rodent in the family Gliridae found in eastern Europe, the Balkans and parts of western Central Asia.  It is categorized as being of least concern in the \"IUCN List of Threatened Species\" due to its wide range and stable population trend.  Forest dormice have a diploid count (2n) of 48 chromosomes.  Even though this species lives in a variety of geographic locations, its greatest population density is in the forests of central Moldova, in Transcaucasia, in the mountains of Central Asia.  In most other locations, population density of this species is rather low.  Population density is dependent on many factors.  But the main features that this species depends on for choosing a location are the presence of the appropriate food sources as well as good foliage that can be used for a habitat.  The reason why the forests in central Moldova have the highest population density is they provide the largest diversity of food sources which are available throughout the year.  This location also provides the best type of foliage for the forest dormice to build their nests as well as swing from branches.  The combination of both of these aspects allows for this species to have its highest needs met.  Therefore, during mating season they produce offspring who also stay in the same general area when they mature.  It makes sense not to move from an area if it is providing for your most basic needs.

This fork in the river is historically important in the development of early Chicago.  This was the location of Chicago's first three taverns, its first hotel, Sauganash Hotel, its first ferry, its first drug store, its first church, and the first bridges across the Chicago River.  The name is said to possibly derive from a Native American Chief whose name translated to wolf, but alternate theories exist.

The river rises in the extreme southern edges of the Appalachian Highlands and flows 178 miles (286 km) to the Tombigbee River, of which the Black Warrior is the primary tributary.  The river is named after the Mississippian paramount chief Tuskaloosa, whose name meant 'Black Warrior' in Muskogean.  The Black Warrior is impounded along nearly its entire course by a series of locks and dams to form a chain of reservoirs that not only provide a path for an inland waterway, but also yield hydroelectric power, drinking water, and industrial water. Opechancanough or Opchanacanough ( ) (1554–1646) was a tribal chief within the Powhatan Confederacy of what is now Virginia in the United States, and its paramount chief from sometime after 1618 until his death in 1646.

Pinu village is located on the coast line of western Central Province, Papua New Guinea.  The village is accessible by road and would take about 90 kilometers by motor vehicle on Hiritano highway.  The village is the biggest settlement in the Kabadi area.  The villagers passionately call themselves 'Abadi Pinu'.  The word \"abadi\" refers to power, ownership and prestige by the paramount chief, while 'Kabadi' refers to communal ownership or origin.  Abadi literally means 'I own' and only the paramount chief can make that statement.  As the original settlers and owner of all the land in Kabadi, the Pinu people are referred to as Kabadi or Abadi Pinu.  It must be also highlighted that the nearby villages such as Ukaukana, Kave ona, Kou ' puana have very close ties to Pinu having broke away from Pinu, therefore, they are also referred to as Kabadi, but can never claim and use the term 'Abadi'. Summons of the Soul, Summoning of the Soul, or Zhao Hun (; Pinyin: Zhāo Hún) is one of the poems anthologized in the ancient Chinese poetry collection, the \"Chu Ci\".  The \"Summons of the Soul\" consists of a four-part poem.  The first part consists of a few lines with no clear relationship to the rest of the poem.  The second part is a prolog in the form of a conversation in heaven, in which God (帝) orders the Ancestor Shaman Wu Yang (巫陽) to go down below to earth and help out in the case of someone whose soul has wandered off.  Part three is the actual summoning of the soul, by means of threats and temptations.  The fourth part is an epilog (\"luan\").  (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 222) The authorship of \"Summons of the Soul\" has been attributed to Qu Yuan, but Song Yu is more likely.  (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 223) The \"Summons of the Soul\" is very similar, but longer, than another of the \"Chu ci\" poems, \"The Great Summons\" (\"Da zhao\").  Both poems derive from a shamanic tradition of summoning the soul of someone who has seemed to die, most likely originally with the intention of having it to re-animate its former body (but in the later literary tradition this was meant more allegorically).  The two poems both follow a similar pattern: threats of dangers lurking in all directions to which the soul might wander and then detailed lists with tempting descriptions of magnificent sensual pleasures which would be available as a reward for the souls obedient return (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 219-221) Myron is a masculine given name used in English-speaking and Eastern European countries including Romania, Ukraine and Russia (in the former USSR it is usually spelled Miron).  Non-religious or Christianized Jews used this name as a Gentile replacement of the Jewish name Meir.  This use was originally in honor of the ancient Greek sculptor Myron (Greek Μύρων), whose name meant \"myrrh, perfume\" in ancient Greek.  Myron was fairly popular as a male given name in the United States during the early part of the 20th century.  The popularity of the name declined during the 1960s and it is very rare today to see young people with the name Myron.  The female equivalent of Myron is considered to be \"Myra\".

Bartolommeo moved to England with \"Antony Toto\" (Antonio di Nunziato d'Antonio) and served as a court artist to Henry VIII of England between 1531 and 1533.  He probably came to Henry from Cardinal Wolsey, as he and Toto first appear in the accounts just after Wolsey's fall in October 1529.  \"Toto\" had been signed on in Florence in 1519 as an assistant to Pietro Torrigiano, who in fact left England for good later that year.  Toto and Penni spent most of their time after 1538 working on Nonsuch Palace, including elaborate stucco work for Henry's most advanced building, now vanished.  Penni is recorded as still in England in 1538 and also worked as painter-decorator to Henry's son and successor Edward VI of England.

Jane was raised in England and India, before marrying a naval officer and settling in London.  She soon left him for another military officer, Edward Ellerker Williams.  After Edward and she left England for Italy, they became acquainted with Percy and Mary Shelley.  Though she never had a romantic relationship with Shelley, near the end of his life he became deeply infatuated with her and addressed several of his poems to her.  After Shelley and Edward Williams perished in a boating accident, she lived with Thomas Jefferson Hogg, also a close friend of Shelley, and had two children with him.  The rest of her life was spent as a housewife in London. Helen Spurway (Helen Haldane) (c. 1917 – 15 February 1978, Hyderabad) was a biologist and the second wife of J. B. S. Haldane.

Ivan Orloff (Lee Beggs) and his unnamed wife (Blanche Cornwall) are poor peasants, presumably living in the Russian Empire.  Ivan is shown sitting on a cart while his wife walks alongside their horse, helping to pull the cart.  The husband whips both the horse and his wife indiscriminately.  The wife is represented as completely subordinated, as just another beast.  On their way, they meet a group of emigrants who invite Ivan to join them.  When Ivan, together with his wife, arrives in America, \"the land of freedom,\" he learns four \"lesson[s] in Americanism\" that turn him into a respectful husband with regard to his wife.  The first lesson takes place upon landing.  Ivan has his wife carry a huge bundle on her back.  When she succumbs under the weight of the bundle, Ivan starts prodding her with a stick, threatening to beat her.  A gentleman approaches them, picks up the bundle and puts it on Ivan's back.  The gentleman takes the stick from Ivan, hands it to the wife and shows her how to prod Ivan.  The second \"lesson in Americanism\" takes place in the couple's new home at Odessa Inn.  Threatening his wife, Ivan asks her to take off his shoes.  He beats her and knocks her to the floor.  A man comes in and asks Ivan to put the wife in bed.  After Ivan reluctantly does that, the man knocks him down to the floor the way Ivan did to his wife.  The third lesson takes place in the countryside.  The couple no longer lives at the inn but owns a house and some land.  The wife no longer wears a scarf.  She toils in the garden, while Ivan sits in a chair smoking a pipe.  When she protests, Ivan goes to beat her, but a passer-by stops him and punches him several times, forcing him to tend to his wife who has fainted and work instead of her.  Ivan's wife begins to live in an increasingly \"American way.\"  She learns to stand up to his abuse.  They have another feud, this time while having dinner in their house.  While they are scuffling with each other, two men come in and break them up.  For Ivan's fourth and final \"lesson in Americanism,\" he gets sentenced to hard labor for six months.  In prison, he cracks and becomes \"completely Americanized.\"  The ending shows Ivan in the garden and his wife calling him for dinner.  As they sit down to the table, they both seem happy and equal.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_78", "context": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin\" ) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists and doctors in the various fields of physiology or medicine.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.  As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute.  While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for \"physiology or medicine\" in his will.  Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields.  The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.  In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008.  In 2013, the prize was awarded to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof; they were recognised \"after discovering how cells precisely transport material\".  The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. This is a list of Danish Nobel laureates.  Since the Nobel Prize was established per the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel in 1895, 12 of the prize winners have been from Denmark.  The first Danish Nobel laureate was Niels Ryberg Finsen, who won a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1903 for his work in using light therapy to treat diseases.  The most recent Danish Nobel Prize winner was Jens Skou who won the prize in chemistry for his discovery over the enzyme, Na+/K+-ATPase in 1997.  To date, of the 13 Nobel Prizes won by Danish people, 5 have been for medicine, 3 have been for physics, 3 have been for literature, 1 has been for chemistry and one has been for peace.

Best known for his pioneering work on superconductivity and quantum tunnelling, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his prediction of the Josephson effect, made in 1962 when he was a 22-year-old PhD student at Cambridge University.  Josephson is the only Welshman to have won a Nobel Prize in Physics.  He shared the prize with physicists Leo Esaki and Ivar Giaever, who jointly received half the award for their own work on quantum tunnelling. Leo James Rainwater (December 9, 1917 – May 31, 1986) was an American physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 for his part in determining the asymmetrical shapes of certain atomic nuclei. Aage Niels Bohr (] ; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\".  Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments.  Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

A major figure in 20th century theoretical physics, he shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the electroweak unification theory.  He was the first Pakistani and first Muslim to receive a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize (after Anwar Sadat of Egypt). Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i litteratur\" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: \"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.

By the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was replaced with a tendency towards calm and smoothness, with the sounds of cool jazz, which favoured long, linear melodic lines.  It emerged in New York City, as a result of the mixture of the styles of predominantly white swing jazz musicians and predominantly black bebop musicians, and it dominated jazz in the first half of the 1950s.  The starting point were a series of singles on Capitol Records in 1949 and 1950 of a nonet led by trumpeter Miles Davis, collected and released first on a ten-inch and later a twelve-inch as the \"Birth of the Cool\".  Cool jazz recordings by Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Gil Evans, Stan Getz and the Modern Jazz Quartet usually have a \"lighter\" sound which avoided the aggressive tempos and harmonic abstraction of bebop.  Cool jazz later became strongly identified with the West Coast jazz scene, but also had a particular resonance in Europe, especially Scandinavia, with emergence of such major figures as baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin and pianist Bengt Hallberg.  The theoretical underpinnings of cool jazz were set out by the blind Chicago pianist Lennie Tristano, and its influence stretches into such later developments as Bossa nova, modal jazz, and even free jazz.  See also the list of cool jazz and West Coast musicians for further detail. Joseph Bodner (January 16, 1925 - May 28, 1982) was an American painter.

The Healthy Americans Act (HAA), also known as the Wyden-Bennett Act, is a Senate bill that had proposed to improve health care in the United States, with changes that included the establishment of universal health care.  It would transition away from employer-provided health insurance, to employer-subsidized insurance, having instead individuals choose their health care plan from state-approved private insurers.  It sought to make the cost of health insurance more transparent to consumers, with the expectation being that this would increase market pressures to drive health insurance costs down.  The proposal created a system that would be paid for by both public and private contributions.  It would establish Healthy Americans Private Insurance Plans (HAPIs) and require those who do not already have health insurance coverage, and who do not oppose health insurance on religious grounds, to enroll themselves and their children in a HAPI.  According to its sponsors, it would guarantee universal, affordable, comprehensive, portable, high-quality, private health coverage that is as good or better than Members of Congress have today; A 2008 preliminary analysis by the Congressional Budget Office concluded it would be \"essentially\" self-financing in the first year that it was fully implemented.

The Act placed a price ceiling on interstate commerce and transportation companies to ensure fair market value of prices.  The Act extended the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate the telecommunications industry, and designated telephone, telegraph and wireless companies as common carriers. .  The act placed all telecommunications under the ICC's control.  It was passed by the United States Senate, 50-12. Cesar Mora is an Australian professional vert skater.  Cesar is the poster boy for professionalism in rollerblading.

In 1998, he won vert gold, and he has two vert silver medals ('95, '99) and a bronze ('00).  A number one ranked skater and world champion several times.  Skating for Roces skates from 1994 to 1998 then switching to K2 skates from 1999 to 2004.  Born in Madrid, Spain, 3 February, and having lived most of his life in Sydney Australia, Cesar represented Australia also in soccer at a youth level, travelling to US and England before landing in his city of birth Madrid and training with professional Spanish side Rayo Vallecano for several months who at the time were in the 4th division of the Spanish league.  He returned to Sydney and started skating at the beautiful Bondi Beach where he honed his skills on the ramp and launched himself on an international skating career that took him around the world and back several times.  Always creative, explosive and exciting to watch, Cesar made his mark on many up and coming skaters offering a drug-free life style and a healthy living.

Sometimes referred to as the king of vert, Cesar pushed the sport in 1998 by being the 1st skater in history to land a 1080 and later on that year a reverse 1260.  Hailing from the very innovative Australian skating scene he always tried to push the boundaries and try new things, create new ways of performing tricks and innovating, adding his unique style to everything he did, and with these efforts and risks comes injuries, he certainly had his share but somehow managed to avoid broken bones until the end of 2000 whilst performing at the melbourne planet x games he fell and broke his left arm and wrist.  The physical recovery was fast but the mental recovery took some time, and that year he took on less competitions and concentrated on healing and safety.  Once the confidence returned the usual big tricks were on display and among the variety of spins, flips and airs for many years he was known for his giant backflips, always a crowd pleaser.  Cesar, ever the showman, never left a ramp without giving his all, whether it be the x games or a small show in a village in Peru where the ramp may have been less than appropriate.  He always wanted to leave the kids and fans with something special and signed every autograph.  He relished his position as a role model and this made him actually wear a helmet, because when he started and on his 1st tour of the states he never liked wearing a helmet and was told no helmet-no skate.  A proud person with an enviable list of achievements, he relished his time on tour and is always grateful of anyone who helped him along the way.

His 1968 novel, \"Once An Eagle\", written at the peak of the Vietnam War, is required reading for all Marines and is frequently used in leadership training at West Point.  The novel, considered a classic of military literature and a guide to honorable conduct in the profession of arms, has been compared favorably to Leo Tolstoy's magnum opus \"War and Peace\".

Myrer wrote his novel to warn against ambition without principle and the military-industrial complex.  Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale are the vehicles for this warning.  Damon is an honorable soldier who rises in rank by success in field command.  He is a soldier of character with his men's welfare in mind.  Massengale has no honor and rises in rank through staff positions by cunning and political connections.  He is driven by lust for power and cares nothing for the welfare of soldiers.

In Domesday her sole possession was the manor of Werrington, a very large settlement on the Cornish / Devon border. Seaxburh (died c. 674) was a queen of Wessex.  She is also called Queen of the Gewisse, an early name for the tribe which ruled Wessex.  She is said to have ruled Wessex for about a year after the death of her husband, Cenwalh, in 672.  It was extremely rare for a woman to rule in her own right in Anglo-Saxon England, and she was the only woman to appear in a regnal list.  She may have ruled for over a year, as the next reign is entered in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" in 674. Saint Margaret of Scotland (c. 1045 – 16 November 1093), also known as Margaret of Wessex, was an English princess of the House of Wessex.  Margaret was sometimes called \"The Pearl of Scotland\".  Born in exile in the Kingdom of Hungary, she was the sister of Edgar Ætheling, the shortly reigned and uncrowned Anglo-Saxon King of England.  Margaret and her family returned to the Kingdom of England in 1057, but fled to the Kingdom of Scotland following the Norman conquest of England in 1066.  In 1070 Margaret married King Malcolm III of Scotland, becoming Queen of Scots.  She was a very pious Roman Catholic, and among many charitable works she established a ferry across the Firth of Forth in Scotland for pilgrims travelling to St Andrews in Fife, which gave the towns of South Queensferry and North Queensferry their names.  Margaret was the mother of three kings of Scotland, or four, if Edmund of Scotland, who ruled with his uncle, Donald III, is counted, and of a queen consort of England.  According to the \"Vita S. Margaritae (Scotorum) Reginae\" (\"Life of St. Margaret, Queen (of the Scots)\"), attributed to Turgot of Durham, she died at Edinburgh Castle in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1093, merely days after receiving the news of her husband's death in battle.  In 1250 Pope Innocent IV canonized her, and her remains were reinterred in a shrine in Dunfermline Abbey in Fife, Scotland.  Her relics were dispersed after the Scottish Reformation and subsequently lost.  Mary, Queen of Scots at one time owned her head, which was subsequently preserved by Jesuits in the Scottish College, Douai, France, from where it was subsequently lost during the French Revolution. Godwin of Wessex (Old English: \"Godƿin\" ; 100115 April 1053) was one of the most powerful earls in England under the Danish king Cnut the Great and his successors.  Cnut made him the first Earl of Wessex.  Godwin was the father of King Harold Godwinson and Edith of Wessex, wife of King Edward the Confessor. Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin and Caelin, died \"ca.\"  593) was a King of Wessex.  He may have been the son of Cynric of Wessex and the grandson of Cerdic of Wessex, whom the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" represents as the leader of the first group of Saxons to come to the land which later became Wessex.  Ceawlin was active during the last years of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native Britons by the time of his death. Máel Muire (died 1021) was Queen of Ireland, being actually styled so in the Annals of Clonmacnoise.  The wife of Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, High King of Ireland, she was a daughter of Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Dublin until 980/1 and formerly King of York.  Thus she was a member of the Norse-Irish Uí Ímair dynasty and the first Queen of Ireland of ultimately foreign or non-Celtic lineage known to be historical.  One of her brothers was the celebrated King of Dublin Sitric Silkbeard, while a sister Gytha was wife to Olaf Tryggvason, King of Norway.

He is figured prominently in the Norse Sagas under the name Harald, to allude to his grandfather, Harold II of England.  Mstislav's Christian name was Theodore. Edmund Ætheling ( ;  1015–17 – possibly 1046, certainly by 1054) was a member of the royal House of Wessex as the son of Edmund Ironside, who briefly ruled as King of England between April and November 1016.  He fought the Danish Vikings under Cnut the Great, but following the Danish victory at the Battle of Assandun in October, it was agreed that Ironside would rule Wessex, while Cnut took Mercia and probably Northumbria.  In November 1016, Ironside died and Cnut became King of all England. Gytha Thorkelsdóttir (Old English: \"Gȳða Þorkelsdōttir\" , 997 – c. 1069), also called Githa, was a Danish noblewoman.  She was the mother of King Harold Godwinson and of Edith of Wessex, queen consort of King Edward the Confessor of England. Judith of Flanders (or Judith of France) ( 843 – c. 870) was queen consort of Wessex and countess consort of Flanders.  She was the eldest daughter of the West Frankish King and later Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Bald and his wife Ermentrude of Orléans.  Through her marriages to two Kings of Wessex, Æthelwulf and Æthelbald, she was twice a queen.  Her first two marriages were childless, but through her third marriage to Baldwin, she became the first Countess of Flanders and an ancestor of later Counts of Flanders.  One of her sons by Baldwin married Ælfthryth, a daughter of Æthelbald's brother, Alfred the Great.

The Lawrence Durrell Collection is a special collection of books and periodicals by, about or associated with the novelist and poet Lawrence Durrell, donated to the British Library by Alan G. Thomas. German nationality law is the law governing the acquisition, transmission and loss of German citizenship.  The law is based on a mixture of the principles of \"jus sanguinis\" and \"jus soli\".  In other words, one usually acquires German citizenship if a parent is a German citizen, irrespective of place of birth, or by birth in Germany to parents with foreign nationality if certain requirements are fulfilled.  Naturalisation is also possible for foreign nationals after six to eight years of legal residence in Germany.  However, non-EU and non-Swiss citizens must usually renounce their old citizenship before being naturalised in Germany.  Citizens of other EU countries and of Switzerland usually can keep their old citizenship.  Some EU countries do not allow dual citizenship even with other EU countries.  German citizens wanting to acquire a non-EU or non-Swiss citizenship and to maintain their German citizenship must apply for a permission (\"Beibehaltungsgenehmigung\") before acquiring the other citizenship, or they will automatically lose their German citizenship when they acquire the foreign citizenship.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_103", "context": "The Sayre Champlin Service Station is a historic service station located on old U.S. Route 66 in Sayre, Oklahoma.  The station, an affiliate of the Champlin Refining Company, was built in 1934; it replaced an older station which predated Route 66.  Its main building has a Streamline Moderne design which features oval pilasters and horizontal sections, plate glass and multi-light windows, and a contrasting color scheme.  The station provided both gasoline and automobile services to Route 66 travelers; in addition, the large tanker trucks used to supply the station's gasoline contributed to the highway's traffic.  After Interstate 40 bypassed Route 66 in 1958, business at the station declined, and it closed permanently in 1967. U.S. Route 66 (US 66, Route 66) is a former east–west United States Numbered Highway, running from Santa Monica, California to Chicago, Illinois.  In Missouri, the highway ran from downtown St. Louis at the Mississippi River to the Kansas state line west of Joplin.  The highway was originally Route 14 from St. Louis to Joplin and Route 1F from Joplin to Kansas.  It underwent two major realignments (in the St. Louis and Joplin areas) and several lesser realignments in the cities of St. Louis, Springfield, and Joplin.  Current highways covering several miles of the former highway include Route 100, Route 366, Route 266, Route 96, and Route 66.  Interstate 44 (I-44) approximates much of US 66 between St. Louis and Springfield. The Casa Grande Hotel is a historic hotel located at the intersection of 3rd Street and historic U.S. Route 66 in downtown Elk City, Oklahoma.  The hotel opened in 1928, shortly after Route 66 was designated, to lodge the growing number of travelers on the highway.  Architects Hawk and Parr designed the four-story building in the Spanish Eclectic style; their design features arched windows and doors and stone ornamentation along the arches.  Spanish-influenced styles such as the Spanish Eclectic were common on the southwestern portion of Route 66 due to the region's Spanish history.  The luxury hotel faded in popularity after the 1920s, and as a result, the Casa Grande is the only high-rise hotel on Route 66 between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas. Shea's Gas Station Museum Center piece The Mahan Filling Station located on Route 66 in Springfield, Illinois was transformed from a working Texaco, and later Marathon, station into a world-renowned museum by owner Bill Shea and his wife Helen.  The museum contains an eclectic mix of vintage gas station memorabilia collected over the last fifty years including the original gas pumps, wooden phone booths, signs, photos, and other mementos reminiscent of old Route 66 service stations.  In February 2000, the former Mahan's Station, rumored to be the oldest filling station in Illinois, was moved 21 miles to its current location at Fulgenzi's.  It has since been fully restored.  The museum’s guestbook boasts visitors from all over Europe and Asia and has become a destination for international travelers exploring the Mother Road.  Due to his commitment to preserving Route 66 history and gas station memorabilia, plus his many years of quality service to his customers, Bill Shea and his shop were inducted into the Route 66 Hall of Fame in 1993.  The entire Shea family was inducted in 2002.  Bill Shea died in December 2013 and the gas station was sold.  The museum contents were auctioned in 2015.  The Fulgenzi Family Saved the Museums Center piece, The Mahan Filling Station and its now open to the Public at Fulgenzi's Pizza & Pasta 1168 Sangamon Avenue, Springfield, Illinois 62702 . Route 66 Mural Park (opened 2013 in Joplin, Missouri) operates as a public park, specifically as a touchstone for US Route 66 tourists as well as for local preservers of U.S. Route 66 in Missouri.  The park includes two large tile murals proposed by Paul Whitehill, produced by Images In Tile USA and designed by artists Chris Auckerman and Jon White.  The park also features a bifurcated red sports car that anyone on pilgrimage can slide up beside and have a quickie photograph taken.  Close to the intersection of 7th Street and Main, the mural covers the south side of Pearl Brothers, the iconic green hardware store of downtown Joplin.  Near that same intersection, US Route 66 once shifted west and headed into Kansas. The Dixie Travel Plaza, previously known as the Dixie Truck Stop and Dixie Trucker's Home, is a large trucker and travel plaza located in McLean, Illinois, on Interstate 55.  It was established by J.P. Walters and John Geske in 1928 on old US Route 66 as a small sandwich stand in a truck mechanic's garage.  By 1930, quickly growing demand had necessitated expansion into a full-size restaurant.  The restaurant was expanded several times afterwards, and rebuilt once after a fire in 1965.  Walters, Geske and the Dixie Trucker's Home have been recognized by the Route 66 Association of Illinois for their contributions—from 1926 to 1977—to the character of Route 66.  They were inducted into the association's hall of fame on June 9, 1990.  Dixie was previously home to the Route 66 Hall of Fame when it opened in 1990.  In 2003, after Dixie changed ownership, the museum was moved to a new, larger location in Pontiac, Illinois. U.S. Route 66 (US 66 or Route 66), also known as the Will Rogers Highway, the Main Street of America or the Mother Road, was one of the original highways within the U.S. Highway System.  US 66 was established on November 11, 1926, with road signs erected the following year.  The highway, which became one of the most famous roads in the United States, originally ran from Chicago, Illinois, through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before ending at Santa Monica, California, covering a total of 2448 mi .  It was recognized in popular culture by both the hit song \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" and the \"Route 66\" television show in the 1960s. U.S. Route 66 (US 66, Route 66) covered 401 mi as part of a former United States Numbered Highway in the state of Arizona.  The highway ran from west to east, starting in Needles, California, through Kingman and Seligman to the New Mexico state line as part of the historic US 66 from Santa Monica, California, to Chicago, Illinois.  The highway was decommissioned in 1985, although portions remain as State Route 66 (SR 66). Route 66 is a state highway located in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States.  It runs 3.62 mi between Route 33 in Tinton Falls and Route 35 at County Route 16 on the border of Ocean Township and Neptune Township, just to the west of Asbury Park.  The route serves as an important connector between the Garden State Parkway to the west and Route 18 and Asbury Park to the east.  It runs concurrent with County Route 16 from Bowne/Wayside Roads to the eastern terminus at Route 35.  Route 66, which varies from a two-lane undivided road to a four-lane divided highway, passes through commercial areas for most of its length with some wooded areas.  The route was created in 1953, replacing what had been Route 33-35 Link.  There is currently a proposal to widen the two-lane portion between Jumping Brook Road and Wayside Road in order to better handle the traffic that uses this road. Angel Delgadillo is a businessowner in Seligman, Arizona who has been dubbed the 'guardian angel' of U.S. Route 66.  He is the main founder of the Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona, established in 1987 to campaign for \"Historic Route 66\" signage on the former US highway; similar initiatives have since been established in every U.S. Route 66 state.", "com_question": "In which city is the shopping center located?

In 2016, he appeared on Broadway in the play \"Chicago\" as the hustling lawyer Billy Flynn. The Heisman curse is a term coined to reference a two-part assertion of a negative future for the winning player of the Heisman Trophy.  The \"curse\" supposes that any college football player who wins the Heisman plays on a team that will likely lose its subsequent bowl game.  The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1–5 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4–8 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1–6).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the \"curse\" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables. Emerson Boozer (born July 4, 1943) is a former running back in the American Football League (AFL) and in the National Football League (NFL).

Founded as the Kiel Opera House, it opened in 1934 and operated until 1991, when it and the adjacent Kiel Auditorium were closed so the auditorium could be demolished and replaced by the Scottrade Center.  When the auditorium was slated for demolition, the owners of the complex promised to rehabilitate the opera house as well.  The owners, however, never renovated the building, instead claiming that they had fulfilled their financial obligations.  In June 2009, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen voted 25–1 to subsidize the renovation and reopening of the Opera House under the direction of its new owners, Sports Capital Partners.  The subsidies were funded by municipal bonds and state/federal historic tax credits.  On July 12, 2010, it was announced that the name of the opera house would be changed to the Peabody Opera House, named after the company Peabody Energy.  The renovation lasted for fourteen months and included the construction of a new entrance for the building. Una follia is an opera in one act by composer Gaetano Donizetti.  The work premiered on 15 December 1818 at the Teatro San Luca in Venice.  The opera uses the same Italian-language libretto by Bartolomeo Merelli after August von Kotzebue's \"Der Graf von Burgund\" that Donizetti used for his \"Enrico di Borgogna\" a month earlier, but with different music.  It was given one performance and \"never performed again, and its score has never been found.\" Bartolomeo Merelli (19 May 1794 – 10 April 1879) was an Italian impresario and librettist, best known as the manager of the La Scala Milan opera house between 1829 and 1850, and for his support for the young Giuseppe Verdi. The Phoenix Opera House Block is a historic building in Rushville, Illinois.  Built in 1882, the building housed commercial businesses on the first floor and an opera house on the second floor.  The opera house hosted traveling performers and theater companies as well as local social events.  The opera house closed in 1910, as churches began to host the town's social functions and the local movie theater provided entertainment.  From 1924 to 1956, the opera house served as a Masonic lodge.  The building is one of the few surviving examples of a combined opera house and commercial building. Shanghai Opera House (; Shanghainese: Zånhae Gujihyu) is the official government-funded western-style opera company of Shanghai, China, and the resident opera company at the new Shanghai Grand Theatre (上海大剧院 \"Shanghai Da Juyuan\").  Although the term \"Opera House\" is often applied to the building, both in English and Chinese texts, officially the building is not an opera house and the term \"Shanghai Opera House\" properly applies only to the performing company, not the building, as is also true for its senior sister company, the China National Opera House (CNOH) in Beijing.  The reason for the distinction is found in that the Chinese character \"Yuan\" (院) applies primarily to a school or institute or dramatic troupe rather than the building in which a school, institute or dramatic company resides. Le nozze in villa (The Wedding in the Villa) is an \"opera buffa\" in two acts by Gaetano Donizetti, dating to early in his career.  Completed in 1819, it was premiered at the Teatro Vecchio in Mantua sometime during the carnival season of 1820-1821; the exact date is uncertain.  The libretto by Bartolomeo Merelli is based on the play \" Die deutschen Kleinstädter\" by August von Kotzebue.  The opera was a failure at its premiere, and has disappeared from performance since; save for a performance in Genoa in the spring of 1822 as \"I provinciali, ossia Le nozze in villa\", no further mountings are known.  Donizetti's autograph score has vanished, but an incomplete copy of the work, missing a quintet from Act II, exists in the library of the Conservatoire de Paris. Royal Opera House, also known as Opera House in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), is India's only surviving opera house.  Situated on Charni Road, near Girgaum Chowpatti beach, the adjective ‘Royal’ was prefixed to ‘Opera House’ to reflect the fact that its foundation stone was laid during the British Raj in 1909, and King George V inaugurated the building in 1911 while the building was still under construction.  Work on the Royal Opera House was completed in 1912, although additions were made to the building up to 1915.  After years of neglect following its closure in 1993, restoration work started in 2008.  The exterior restoration was completed in 2011 and restoration was completed in 2016.  The area around the theatre is also referred to as the Opera House in Mumbai.The Opera House area has many jewellery, metal and IT companies.  On 21 October 2016, after a gap of 23 years, Royal Opera House hosted performance of Bombay-born British soprano Patricia Rozario and her husband, pianist Mark Troop.  The private event was organised by Opera House owners Maharaja Joytendrasinhji Jadeja and Maharani Kumud Kumari Jadeja of Gondal, Gujarat. Following the success of \"Linda di Chamounix\", \"Caterina Cornaro\" was commissioned by Bartolomeo Merelli, impresario of the Kaertnerthortheater in Vienna, and was partly composed in 1842, just before \"Don Pasquale\", and completed during the following summer.  The Viennese realised that the same subject had been set to music the preceding year by Franz Lachner and the debut was cancelled.  Donizetti dedicated himself instead to \"Maria di Rohan\", presented at the Theater am Kärntnertor in June 1843, and searched for a suitable theatre for \"Caterina\".  Two months after the triumph of \"Dom Sébastien\" in Paris, \"Caterina\" was booed at the San Carlo in Naples.  The composer, who had been unable to be present at rehearsals or to oversee the orchestration, had clearly predicted the opera's failure, in a January 1844 communication to his brother-in-law: The Lexington Opera House is a theatre located at 401 West Short Street in downtown Lexington, Kentucky.  Built in 1886, the Opera House replaced the former theatre, located on the corner of Main and Broadway, after fire destroyed it in January 1886.  The new Opera House was designed by the renowned architect Oscar Cobb and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its historical and architectural significance.  Now owned and operated by the Lexington Center Corporation, the Lexington Opera House is host to ballet, opera, children's productions, family shows, comedy, music and professional national Broadway tours.  The Lexington Opera House is one of the only 14 theatres in the country built before 1900 with less than 1,000 seats that is still in operation as a live performance venue.", "com_question": "On what date was the opera house inaugurated?

They have large showy flowers and one species, \"Tigridia pavonia\", is often cultivated for this.  The approximately thirty five species in this family grow in the Western Hemisphere, from Mexico to Chile.  The tigridia flower is short lived, each often blooming for only one day, but often several flowers will bloom from the same stalk.  Usually they are dormant during the winter dry-season.  Its roots are edible and were eaten by the Aztecs of Mexico who called it \"cacomitl\" and its flower \"ocēlōxōchitl\" \"Jaguar flower\".  The genus name means \"tiger-like\" and alludes to the coloration and spotting of the flowers of the type species \"Tigridia pavonia\". Tocantinia is a monotypic genus of herbaceous perennial bulbous plants flowering plants in the Amaryllis (Amaryllidaceae) family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae.  The sole species is Tocantinia mira.

Muscari is a genus of perennial bulbous plants native to Eurasia that produce spikes of dense, most commonly blue, urn-shaped flowers resembling bunches of grapes in the spring.  The common name for the genus is grape hyacinth (a name which is also used for the related genera \"Leopoldia\" and \"Pseudomuscari\", which were formerly included in \"Muscari\"), but they should not be confused with hyacinths.  A number of species of \"Muscari\" are used as ornamental garden plants. In botany, a bulb is structurally a short stem with fleshy leaves or leaf bases that function as food storage organs during dormancy.  (In gardening, plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called \"ornamental bulbous plants\" or just \"bulbs\".)

The flowers are light blue, violet, white, or yellow, depending on the species, of which there are around twenty.  Taxonomists considered that the already known genera \"Salpingostylis\" (endemic from Florida), \"Cardiostigma\" (from Mexico), \"Catila\" (from Brazil) and \"Itysa\" (from Venezuela) are not enough different from each other to justify their taxonomic segregation and, for this reason, all of them are now included in \"Calydorea\".

They are bulbous perennials, originally from sunny, open habitats in Europe and Asia.  Thousands of cultivars are available in a huge range of sizes, shapes and colours (other than pure blue).  They are usually sold as bulbs to be planted in autumn and winter for flowering in mid- to late spring.  They are frequently treated as bedding plants, accompanied by other seasonal favourites such as wallflowers and forget-me-nots, flowering for one season before being discarded.  However, in favoured locations they can be left in the ground to re-appear the following and subsequent years.  Like many other bulbous plants they require a hot, dry dormant period in the summer.

In natural language processing, open information extraction (OIE) is the task of generating a structured, machine-readable representation of the information in text, usually in the form of triples or n-ary propositions.  A proposition can be understood as truth-bearer, a textual expression of a potential fact (e.g., \"Dante wrote the Divine Comedy\"), represented in an amenable structure for computers [e.g., (\"Dante\", \"wrote\", \"Divine Comedy\")].  An OIE extraction normally consists of a relation and a set of arguments.  For instance, (\"Dante\", \"passed away in\" \"Ravenna\") is a proposition formed by the relation \"passed away in\" and the arguments \"Dante\" and \"Ravenna\".  The first argument is usually referred as the subject while the second is considered to be the object. Passed Away is a 1992 American ensemble comedy film directed and written by Charlie Peters.

East Falls is a neighborhood in the Northwest section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States on the east or left bank side of the now submerged Schuylkill River cataracts, the 'Falls of the Schuylkill' that became submerged as the Schuylkill Canal and Fairmount Water Works projects were completed in 1822.  The East Falls community is located adjacent to Germantown, Roxborough, Allegheny West, and Nicetown-Tioga neighborhoods.  East Falls is also adjacent to Wissahickon Valley Park.  The neighborhood runs along a stretch of Ridge Avenue that is only a few miles long, along the banks of the Schuylkill River then extends northeast to Wissahickon Avenue.  East Falls overlooks the multi-use recreational path of Fairmount Park along Kelly Drive, and is desirable for its central location, an easy commute to Center City, with easy access to several major roadways and public transportation.  East Falls continues to develop, with new housing, retail space and recreation centers in production.  It features three streets in proximity with the word \"Queen\" in them (Queen Lane, New Queen Street, and Indian Queen Lane), two train stations, a number of bars and restaurants, a small Korean grocer, illustrious mansions as well as some recently renovated housing that continues to increase in value. The Manayunk Bridge (a.k.a. Manayunk Viaduct) is a historic bridge in Pennsylvania across the Schuylkill River and adjacent Schuylkill Canal between Bala Cynwyd in Montgomery County and the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia.  It is now used as an extension of the Cynwyd Heritage Trail to connect to the Schuylkill River Trail after a rail-to-trail conversion. Schuylkill Canal is the common, but technically inaccurate, name for the Schuylkill Navigation, a 19th-century commercial waterway in and along the Schuylkill River in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.  The \"canal\" was actually a system of interconnected canals and slack-water pools in the river, which is called a navigation.  Chartered in 1815, the Schuylkill Navigation opened in 1825 to provide transportation and water power.  At the time, the river was the least expensive and most efficient method of transporting bulk cargo, and the eastern seaboard cities of the U.S. were experiencing an energy crisis due to over forestation.  It fostered the mining of anthracite coal as the major source of industry between Pottsville and eastern markets.  Along the tow-paths, mules pulled barges of coal from Port Carbon through the water gaps to Pottsville; locally to the port and markets of Philadelphia; and some then by ship or through additional New Jersey waterways, to New York City markets. The Schuylkill Canal Association (SCA) is a non-governmental organization that maintains the Oakes Reach and Lock #60 of the Schuylkill Canal as a public recreation area and historical site.  Organized in 1982 as the Schuylkill Canal Advisory Board, the Association, in cooperation with Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, maintains the canal reach, associated structures, parks and trails.  The area extends along the canal and left bank of the Schuylkill River, from Mont Clare past Port Providence.  The area makes up a large part of the Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section Historic District (#88000462). Port Providence is an unincorporated village along the Schuylkill River in Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States.  Originally known as Jacobs, then Lumberville, the village is located on one of the two remaining watered stretches of the Schuylkill Canal.  The village was notable as having one of the few inns on the canal between Norristown and Pottstown.  Fitzwater Station, a historic tavern, is located in Port Providence, on the canal. The Aqueduct Bridge (also called the Alexandria Aqueduct) was a bridge between Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and Rosslyn, Virginia.  It was built to transport cargo-carrying boats on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in Georgetown across the Potomac River to the Alexandria Canal.  The same eight piers supported two different bridges: a wooden canal bridge (a wooden roadway bridge was added on top of the canal later) and an iron truss bridge carrying a roadway and an electric trolley line.  The bridge was closed in 1923 after the construction of the nearby Key Bridge.  The shuttered Aqueduct Bridge was demolished in 1933.", "com_question": "What are the activities along the Manayunk Canal Towpath?

Ballet Master (also \"Balletmaster\", \"Ballet Mistress\" [increasingly archaic English language use], \"Premier Maître de ballet\" or \"Premier Maître de ballet en Chef\") is the term used for an employee of a ballet company who is responsible for the level of competence of the dancers in their company.  In modern times, ballet masters are generally charged with teaching the daily company ballet class and rehearsing the dancers for both new and established ballets in the company's repertoire.  The artistic director of a ballet company, whether a male or female, may also be called its ballet master.  Historic use of gender marking in job titles in ballet (and live theatre) is being supplanted by gender-neutral language job titles regardless of an employee's gender identity or expression (e.g. \"Ballet Master\" in lieu of \"Ballet Mistress\", \"Wig Master\" as an alternative to \"Wig Mistress\"). The English conductor Sir Adrian Boult was a prolific recording artist.  Unlike many musicians, he felt at home in the recording studio and was happy working without an audience.  His recording career ran from November 1920, when working with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes he recorded the ballet music, \"The Good-Humoured Ladies\", to December 1978, when he made his final recording of music by Hubert Parry. The Cairo Opera Ballet Company is the resident ballet company of the Cairo Opera House and a ballet school affiliated to Egypt's Higher Institute of Ballet.  Its foundation began in 1958 during the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser through the efforts of Tharwat Okasha, Egypt's culture minister at the time, and Leonid Lavrovsky, the former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet who took a group of Egyptian dancers to Russia for two years of training.  At the time of its founding, it was the only Arab resident classical ballet company in the Middle East. Sir Adrian Cedric Boult, CH ( ; 8 April 1889 – 22 February 1983) was an English conductor.  Brought up in a prosperous mercantile family, he followed musical studies in England and at Leipzig, Germany, with early conducting work in London for the Royal Opera House and Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company.  His first prominent post was conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1924.  When the British Broadcasting Corporation appointed him director of music in 1930, he established the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became its chief conductor.  The orchestra set standards of excellence that were rivalled in Britain only by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), founded two years later. Prima ballerina assoluta is a title awarded to the most notable of female ballet dancers. To be recognised as a \"prima ballerina assoluta\" is a rare honour, traditionally reserved only for the most exceptional dancers of their generation.  Originally inspired by the Italian ballet masters of the early Romantic ballet, and literally meaning \"absolute first ballerina\", the title was bestowed on a prima ballerina who was considered to be exceptionally talented, above the standard of other leading ballerinas.  The title is very rarely used today and recent uses have typically been symbolic, either in recognition of a prestigious international career, or for exceptional service to a particular ballet company.  There is no universal procedure for designating who may receive the title, which has led to dispute in the ballet community over who can legitimately claim it.  It is usually a ballet company that bestows the title, however some dancers have had the title officially sanctioned by a government or head of state, sometimes for political rather than artistic reasons.  Less common is for a dancer to become identified as a \"prima ballerina assoluta\" as a result of public and critical opinion.", "com_question": "For which ballet company did Adrian Boult conduct early in his career, and who founded the English National Ballet?", "com_reference": "Adrian Boult conducted for Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company early in his career, and the English National Ballet was founded by Dame Alicia Markova and Sir Anton Dolin."}

The company was established in 1985 by Tim and Chris Stamper, founders of Ultimate Play the Game.  During its early years, Rare was backed by an unlimited budget from Nintendo, primarily concentrated on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games.  During this time they created successful titles such as \"Wizards & Warriors\", \"Battletoads\", and \"R.C. Pro-Am\".  Rare became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo, who came to own a large minority stake of the company.  During this period, Rare received international recognition and critical acclaim for games such as \"Donkey Kong Country\", \"GoldenEye 007\", \"Banjo-Kazooie\", \"Perfect Dark\", and \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\". Diddy Kong (ディディーコング , Didī Kongu ) is a fictional character in the \"Donkey Kong\" series of video games, first appearing in the 1994 game \"Donkey Kong Country\".

Ridgemont is one of Oakland's relatively newer affluent neighborhoods in the city's upscale hillside districts, this one located next to Merritt College along Campus Drive.  First developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a tract-home development, albeit one tailored to affluent buyers, the neighborhood's stock of large tract homes has expanded to include exceptional custom estates and mansions perched on the neighborhood's choicest ridges, which offer expansive, uninterrupted views of the south San Francisco Bay.  One of the last undeveloped hillside parcels in the city of Oakland, this district has in recent years added a new, less exclusive subdivision on the western slopes below Campus Drive.  Begun in 2005 by Desilva, a real estate developer, this latest subdivision has nearly completed its first phase of homes on the ridge where the Leona quarry (also known as the Alma pyrite mine) was once in use.  The higher-priced segment of this latest subdivision has, as of 2016, begun to break ground on the restored upper reaches of the former quarry, which has undergone extensive environmental repair in preparation for the new subdivision.  During the early 2010s, the country's continuing economic challenges in general, and the depressed housing market in particular, had slowed the pace of sales of existing units and the construction of the more upscale segment of the project.  With the country's improved economic status by 2016, particularly for the affluent, and notably the ongoing, rapid citywide revitalization (some say \"hypergentrification\") of Oakland, this development's home sales and additional construction have revitalized as well.  Nevertheless, the undeveloped upper hillside of the former quarry –– even after having undergone extensive seeding and terraced hillside reconstitution –– is still visible for miles, even as far away as San Francisco across the Bay. The Embraer E-Jet E2 family is a family of three narrow-body medium-range twin-engine jet airliners developed by Brazilian aerospace company Embraer, replacing the predecessor Embraer E-Jet family.

Announced improvements per seat are 16 to 24% lower fuel burn and 15–25% lower maintenance cost. Competition in the Regional jet market, contrary to the duopoly between Boeing and Airbus in the large jet airliner market, has several players from several countries and continents.

It was previously awarded to Canada and other Commonwealth countries, most of which including Canada have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours.  Today, the Victoria Cross (French: \"Croix de Victoria\" ), created in 1993 and named in honour of the British Victoria Cross is the highest award within the Canadian honours system, taking precedence over all other orders, decorations, and medals.  It is awarded by either the Canadian monarch or his or her viceregal representative, the Governor General of Canada, to any member of the Canadian Forces or allies serving under or with Canadian military command for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing hostile forces.  Whereas in many other Commonwealth countries the relevant version of the Victoria Cross can only be awarded for actions against the enemy in a wartime setting, the Canadian government has a broader definition of the term \"enemy\", and so the Victoria Cross can be awarded for action against armed mutineers, pirates, or other such hostile forces without war being officially declared.  Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters \"VC\" (for both English and French) and also to receive an annuity of C$3,000.  The decoration has not been awarded since its inception. The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 111 members of the British Armed Forces during the Crimean War (also known as the Russian War) that lasted from 1854 to 1856.  The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories.  The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War.  It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command.  The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park.

Being the highest award in the Australian Honours Order of Wearing, the Victoria Cross takes precedence over all other postnominals and Australian orders and decorations.  The Victoria Cross was instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, initially to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War.  Because of its rarity and inherent significance, the VC is highly prized, both as an award and as a collector's item, with one medal being sold for over A$1 million at auction.  Australians have received the Victoria Cross under the Imperial honours system and later under the Australian Honours System, when in 1991 a new but equivalent award was established by letters patent within the Commonwealth of Australia and its Territories, known as the Victoria Cross for Australia.  The Victoria Cross for Australia has been awarded four times: twice to Special Air Service Regiment members, once to a member of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and a posthumous award to a member of the 2nd Commando Regiment.  All four were for actions in the War in Afghanistan. The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 23 members of the British Armed Forces and colonial forces for actions performed during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879.  The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of the armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories.  The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War, and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals.  It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command.  The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, when Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park.

The Victoria Cross is the highest war honour of the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations.  The whole island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until 1922 when it was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.  In 1948 the Irish Free State became the Republic of Ireland and left the Commonwealth in 1949.  Despite this, citizens of the Republic still enlist in the British Army and thus are eligible for the Victoria Cross. James Joseph Magennis VC (spelling originally McGinnes) (27 October 1919 – 12 February 1986) was a Belfast-born recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.  He was the only native of Northern Ireland to receive the Victoria Cross for Second World War service.  Magennis was part of several operations involving X-Craft midget submarines in attacks on Axis ships.  In July 1945 Magennis was serving on HMS \"XE3\" during Operation \"Struggle\".  During an attack on the Japanese cruiser \"Takao\" in Singapore, Magennis showed extraordinary valour and bravery by leaving the submarine for a second time in order to free some explosive charges that had got caught.  His commanding officer Lieutenant Ian Fraser was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 31 July 1945 during the operation. The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded 628 times to 627 recipients for action in the First World War (1914–1918).

It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command.  The award was officially constituted when Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 that was gazetted on 5 February 1856.  The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War.  The first awards ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on August 17, 1861 and was promoted to first lieutenant five months later.  He participated in the Peninsular Campaign and was captured at the Battle of Gaines's Mill.  He later fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run and Battle of South Mountain.  He was promoted to captain on December 13, 1863, led a company at the Battle of Chancellorsville, but he soon month later was appointed major of the 10th United States Colored Infantry.

Orpheus Saeger Woodward (May 1, 1835–June 26, 1919) was an American Union brevet brigadier general during the period of the American Civil War.  Before the war, he was a teacher from northwestern Pennsylvania.  He was part of the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry.  Woodward served in the Antietam Campaign and fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville and at Little Round Top in the Battle of Gettysburg after which he was promoted to colonel.  He was later wounded at Malvern Hill and in the Wilderness which caused him to have his leg amputated.  He received his appointment as brevet brigadier general dated to March 13, 1865. Robert Milton Boody (March 6, 1836 to October 22, 1913) was an American soldier who fought in the American Civil War.  Boody received the country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for his action during the Battle of Williamsburg at Williamsburg, Virginia and the Battle of Chancellorsville at Chancellorsville, Virginia on May 5, 1862 and May 2, 1863.  He was honored with the award on 8 July 1896. The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War (1861–1865), and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville Campaign.  It was fought from April 30 to May 6, 1863, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near the village of Chancellorsville.  Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg.  The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size, General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.  Chancellorsville is known as Lee's \"perfect battle\" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory.  The victory, a product of Lee's audacity and Hooker's timid decision making, was tempered by heavy casualties, including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson.  Jackson was hit by friendly fire, requiring his left arm to be amputated; he died of pneumonia eight days later, a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm. The 125th Pennsylvania Infantry volunteered during the American Civil War and served a 9-month term from August 1862 to May 1863.  It selected the motto In God We Trust.  The Regiment fought at the Battle of Antietam under the leadership of Colonel Jacob C. Higgins less than six weeks after being recruited in Blair, Cambria and Huntingdon Counties.  The Regiment was noted for its charge through the East Woods, along the Great Cornfield, down Smoketown Road, past the Dunker Church, and into the West Woods.  While in formation beyond the Dunker Church in an 'overextended' position, the Regiment repulsed four counterattacks at a price of 229 casualties (33% of engaged) within 20 minutes.  A fifth, heavily reinforced Confederate counterattack forced a retreat with a desperate struggle to retain the Regimental colors.  Two weeks before the end of their enlistment, the 125th Pennsylvania also occupied the perimeter of Chancellorsville, Virginia, during the Battle of Chancellorsville. Chancellorsville is a historic site and unincorporated community in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, about ten miles west of Fredericksburg.  The name of the locale derives from the mid-19th century inn operated by the family of George Chancellor at the intersection of the Orange Turnpike and Orange Plank Road.  The American Civil War Battle of Chancellorsville occurred there in May 1863, and the Battle of the Wilderness was fought nearby in May 1864.  During the 1863 battle, Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson was wounded by friendly fire, dying eight days later on May 10, 1863, from pneumonia.

Joe Team, and debuted in 1982 as a Missile Commander, but was later promoted to full commander of the team.  Hawk is portrayed by Dennis Quaid in the 2009 live-action film \"\". The Hasbro G.I. Joe Hall of Fame era of 12\" action figures began in 1991, when Hasbro released the Target Exclusive Duke in response to the high demand from nostalgic collectors of the vintage era G.I. Joe action figures.  Duke was the first 12\" (30 cm) action figure produced in the Hasbro G.I. Joe line since 1978.  During the G.I. Joe Hall of Fame era, Hasbro introduced several new products to the world of action figure collectibles.  The first innovation was the limited edition, individually numbered collectible figures.  These figures had collectors scrambling to find the lowest numbers which were expected to have the highest resale value.  Hasbro also used variant sets (also known as chase sets) to increase demand and interest in the figures.  Additionally, talking voice chips were used in some figures; and limited edition action figure sets were released for the Street Fighter II video game and movie characters, and also for the Mortal Kombat characters. The Crimson Guard is an elite organization within the fictional G.I. Joe universe.  They are members of Cobra Command, the nemesis of the G.I. Joe team.  They are often referred to by a phonetic spelling of their organization’s initials, as “Siegies” (in the comics).  Tomax and Xamot are the commanders of the Crimson Guard. A flamethrower is a mechanical incendiary device designed to project a long, controllable stream of fire.  They were first used by the Greeks in the 1st Century AD.  In modern times, they were used during World War I, and more widely in World War II. G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (also known as \"G.I.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_129", "context": "The multiple mini-interview (MMI) is an interview format that uses many short independent assessments, typically in a timed circuit, to obtain an aggregate score of each candidate's soft skills.  In 2001, the McMaster University Medical School began developing the MMI system, to address two widely recognized problems.  First, it has been shown that traditional interview formats or simulations of educational situations do not accurately predict performance in medical school.  Secondly, when a licensing or regulatory body reviews the performance of a physician subsequent to patient complaints, the most frequent issues of concern are those of the non-cognitive skills, such as interpersonal skills, professionalism and ethical/moral judgment.  Since it was formally introduced at McMaster University Medical School in 2004, it has been adopted by medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary schools around the world. Mary Fanton Roberts (1864–1956) was an American journalist and writer.  She was best known as an editor of women's and decorating magazines.  During her long career she was editor of the illustrated monthly \"Demorest’s\", editor-in-chief of \"New Idea Woman’s Magazine\", managing editor of the \"The Craftsman\", and creator and editor of \"The Touchstone\" and \"Decorative Arts\" magazine.  She often wrote articles on the topic of decorative arts and home decorating, and published two books, \"Inside 100 Homes\" and \"101 Ideas for Successful Interiors\".  She was also an avid gardener.  She occasionally wrote criticism under the pen name, Giles Edgerton. The Israeli Government-Christians Forum was initiated in Jerusalem in 2013, by Dr. Mordehcai Zaken, head of the Minorities Affairs Desk, at the Ministry of Public Security, to address and promote their concerns as a minority group.  The decision to establish this forum followed many years of informal and private discussions with activists and leaders, mainly of American and European origin, in an attempt to address their concerns vis-à-vis government agencies and ministries.  Two of the prominent leaders in the side of the Christians helping in establishing this forum have been Charles (Chuck) Kopp, the prominent leader of the Baptist Church in Jerusalem and David Pillegi, Rector of the Christ Church.  On 27 September 2016, the Forum was held for the 7th time since its inauguration.  The aim was to promote a new idea to appoint “trusted liaisons” to the airport authorities, in order to help reduce any potential negative experiences for Christian visitors.The meeting was attended by representatives of government ministries and more than 40 representatives of Christian groups and of NGOs.  Dr. Moti Zaken the head of the Minority Affairs at the Public Security ministry concluded: \"the idea promoted by us to appoint \"airport trustees\" by Christian groups has been received by the Airport Authority, in order to facilitate entry and exit of Christian tourists to Israel, and this is the first time that something like this is possible.  This kind of initiative should not be taken lightly, it is a historic step.\" An availability cascade is a self-reinforcing cycle that explains the development of certain kinds of collective beliefs.  A novel idea or insight, usually one that seems to explain a complex process in a simple or straightforward manner, gains rapid currency in the popular discourse by its very simplicity and by its apparent insightfulness.  Its rising popularity triggers a chain reaction within the social network: individuals adopt the new insight because other people within the network have adopted it, and on its face it seems plausible.  The reason for this increased use and popularity of the new idea involves both the availability of the previously obscure term or idea, and the need of individuals using the term or idea to appear to be current with the stated beliefs and ideas of others, regardless of whether they in fact fully believe in the idea that they are expressing.  Their need for social acceptance, and the apparent sophistication of the new insight, overwhelm their critical thinking. Dulcie Boling (born Elizabeth Dulcie Boling on 29 March 1936) is an Australian businessperson and magazine editor.  She was editor of New Idea magazine from 1977 to 1993.  Boling was a senior executive of Southdown Press, which later became Pacific Magazines. Provoke (Purovōku, プロヴォーク ), with its subtitle of \"Provocative Materials for Thought\" (Shisō no tame no chōhatsuteki shiryō 思想のための挑発的資料 ), was an experimental small press Japanese photography magazine founded in 1968 by critic/photographers and Takuma Nakahira, photographer Yutaka Takanashi, and writer .  Daidō Moriyama joined with the second issue.  \"Provoke\" was \"a platform for a new photographic expression\", \"to free photography from subservience to the language of words\", \"that stood in opposition to the photography establishment\".  It was a quarterly magazine that also included poetry, criticism and photographic theory.  Provoke has been described as having \"lasted for only three issues\" but with \"profound effect upon Japanese photography in the 1970s and 80s,\" and is said to have \"spread a completely new idea of photography in Japan.\" The Brown Dots were an American vocal group initially formed in late 1944, when second tenor Ivory \"Deek\" Watson (b. 18 July 1909, Mounds, Illinois - d. 4 November 1969, Washington, DC) left the Ink Spots.  He immediately put together a competing Ink Spots group consisting of lead tenor Joe King, bass Jimmy Gordon, and an unknown baritone.  By late January 1945, a lawsuit brought by the Ink Spots caused Deek Watson to claim that he would form a new group based on a \"completely new idea\".  This new idea was simply to change their name to the Brown Dots and to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible (although the Brown Dots employed more extensive harmonies).  At this time, the unknown baritone left, to be replaced by baritone/guitarist William \"Pat\" Best. Social judgment theory (SJT) is a self-persuasion theory proposed by Carolyn Sherif, Muzafer Sherif, and Carl Hovland, defined by Sherif and Sherif as the perception and evaluation of an idea by comparing it with current attitudes.  According to this theory, an individual weighs every new idea, comparing it with the individual's present point of view to determine where it should be placed on the attitude scale in an individual's mind.  SJT is the subconscious sorting out of ideas that occurs at the instant of perception. Diffusion is the process by which a new idea or new product is accepted by the market.  The rate of diffusion is the speed with which the new idea spreads from one consumer to the next.  Adoption (the reciprocal process as viewed from a consumer perspective rather than distributor) is similar to diffusion except that it deals with the psychological processes an individual goes through, rather than an aggregate market process.  In economics it is more often named \"technological change\". The hundredth monkey effect is a hypothetical phenomenon in which a new behavior or idea is claimed to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit the new behavior or acknowledge the new idea.", "com_question": "What topics does New Idea Magazine cover?

Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11.  After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18.  It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. The effects of Hurricane Isabel in Virginia proved to be the costliest disaster in the history of Virginia.  Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) on September 18.  It quickly weakened over land as it passed through central Virginia, and Isabel became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on September 19. The effects of Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50 million in damage (2003 USD, $59 million 2008 USD).  Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11.  After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18.  It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.  Several days before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike.  At least one computer model predicted a landfall on New Jersey, and as a result services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane. The effects of Hurricane Isabel in Pennsylvania were primarily related to tropical storm force winds across much of the state.  Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11.  After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18.  It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. The effects of Hurricane Isabel in Delaware resulted in one of only thirteen presidential disaster declarations for the state of Delaware.  Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11.  After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18.  It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over Pennsylvania the next day.  The storm's center remained to the south and west of Delaware, and was about 175 miles (280 km) from Delaware at its closest approach.  At that time, Isabel was a strong tropical storm located in central Virginia. Hurricane Isabel was the costliest, deadliest, and strongest hurricane in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season.  The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11.  After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18.  It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. Hurricane Dean was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.  It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for eighth overall.  Additionally, it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall.  A Cape Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean.  It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20.  The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August 21 as a powerful Category 5 storm.  It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still a hurricane.  It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22.  Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. The Effects of Hurricane Irene in New York were the worst from a hurricane since Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Hurricane Irene formed from a tropical wave on August 21, 2011 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  It moved west-northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters.  Shortly before becoming a hurricane, Irene struck Puerto Rico as a tropical storm.  Thereafter, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) on August 24.  Irene then gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on August 27.  It slowly weakened over land and re-emerged into the Atlantic on the following day.  Later on August 28, Irene was downgraded to a tropical storm and made two additional landfalls, one in New Jersey and another in New York.  The storm quickly began to lose tropical characteristics and became extratropical in Vermont. Hurricane Arthur was the earliest known hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. state of North Carolina, and the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Isaac in 2012.  The first named storm of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur developed from an initially non-tropical area of low pressure over the Southeastern United States that emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean on June 28.  After sufficiently organizing, developing a well-defined circulation and deep convection amid a favorable environment, it was classified a tropical depression on July 1.  The system continued to strengthen, and was declared a tropical storm later that day.  Drifting northward, the storm reached hurricane status early on July 3 and curved toward the north-northeast.  Further structural organization resulted in additional intensification, and by 01:00 UTC on July 4, the system attained its peak winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.  Arthur made landfall at 03:15 UTC over North Carolina's Shackleford Banks, positioned between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, and intensified slightly further, with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg).  The storm then trekked swiftly northeast, weakening as it passed by Cape Cod and Nantucket, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and coming ashore at Weymouth, Nova Scotia, on July 5.  The remnants continued generally northeastward through Atlantic Canada before ultimately dissipating on July 9 over the Labrador Sea. The 1917 Nueva Gerona hurricane was the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the Florida Panhandle until Hurricane Opal in 1995.  The eighth tropical cyclone and fourth tropical storm of the season, this system was identified as a tropical storm east of the Lesser Antilles on September 20.  After crossing the Lesser Antilles, the system entered the Caribbean Sea and achieved hurricane intensity on September 21.  After becoming a Category 2 hurricane, the storm struck the northern coast of Jamaica on September 23.  Early on September 25, the cyclone reached Category 4 status and attained maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) soon thereafter.  Later that day, the hurricane made landfall in eastern Pinar del Río Province, Cuba.  The system entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter and weakened slightly.  Recurving to the northeast, the hurricane briefly threatened Louisiana before turning toward Florida.  Early on September 29, the hurricane made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h).  Once over land, the cyclone rapidly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating on September 30.", "com_question": "What was Hurricane Isabel's peak wind speed?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_144", "context": "Zenji Flava is a common nickname for Zanzibari hip hop, a genre that began to develop in the 1990s.  Cool Para said to be the first rapper to pioneer Zenji Flava during the 90s.  He was using Saleh Jabri's tape to rap on some local shows in Zanzibar until 1996 when he teamed-up with another rapper named Cool Muza together with others they formed a rap group called \"Struggling Islanders.  They made their debut single \"Historia\" in early 1997.  Though the group short-lived and Cool Para and Muza both went to pursue a solo career.  Cool Para was the first rapper in Zanzibar and Tanzania mainland to make rap and taarab fusion called taarap.  With it he went to record a song with the most prominent taarab music band widely known as the East African Melody Modern Taarab, the song was known as \"Loo Umezoea\" which was released early 2000.  He also did \"Kwenye Mataa\" with the same taarab band in 1998.  Before Cool Para, there was also another short-lived crew named Contish.  The group consisted with two members Abdul and Hakim.  They released their only album called \"Mabishoo\" (93).  The album was available all over Zanzibar and Tanzania.  They were using Swahili lyrics over ragga instrumentals such as 'Tingaling' by Shabba Ranks.  Sam,e style as Saleh J. Sometimes later they disbanded and Kim went on pursue a solo and released an album called Kim Pekee.  Abdul went to live abroad.  The name is made of \"zenji\", which is slang for \"Zanzibar\", and \"flava\", which is a corruption of \"flavour\", thus meaning \"of Zanzibari taste\".  As with bongo flava, i.e., Tanzanian mainland's hip hop, zenji flava is usually sung in swahili; the main difference between the two subgenres is that Zanzibari hip hop also reflects some influence of taarab, and thus indirectly of Arab music and Indian music.  Notable zenji flava artists include Ali Haji.  As Zenji flavour goes on it find itself as a sub part of Bongo flava as it has influence from the young generation of artists who want to cop with Bongo flava.  like Offside trick, 2 berry now is separated to form two solo artists（Berry black and Berry white）, Wazenji kijiwe and Shaka zulu, others are East connection which was made up with almost seven groups of artist including Offside trick Brooklyn, Four nature, Jumbo camp, Queen love, and K jam.  It was in this time that Zenji flava was modernized with rapid growth in the number of artists. Reggae fusion is a fusion genre of reggae that mixes reggae or dancehall with other genres, such as pop, rock, R&B, jazz & drum and bass. Blackgaze is a fusion genre combining elements of black metal and shoegazing.  The word is a blend of the names of the two genres, described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the buzz term for a new school of bands taking black metal out of the shadows and melding its blast beats, dungeon wailing and razorwire guitars with the more reflective melodies of post-rock, shoegaze and post-hardcore.\"  According to \"Exclaim! \", blackgaze \"marries the harsh, alien instrumentation of black metal with the mellower, dreamy soundscapes of shoegaze.\"  Influenced by atmospheric black metal bands like Ulver and Summoning, the genre was pioneered by French musician Neige around 2005 through the projects Alcest and Amesoeurs and has risen to prominence with the success of American group Deafheaven.  \"The Guardian\" named Deafheaven \"blackgaze's de facto poster boys, the most likely to open up black metal to an even wider audience\", and \"Exclaim!\"  described their second album \"Sunbather\" – the most critically acclaimed album of 2013 on Metacritic – as seminal to blackgaze. Ryo Kawasaki (川崎 燎 , Kawasaki Ryō , born February 25, 1947) is a jazz fusion guitarist and composer from Tokyo, Japan.  He is best known as one of the first musicians to develop and popularise the fusion genre and for helping to develop the guitar synthesizer in collaboration with Roland Corporation and Korg.  His album \"Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live\" was one of the first all digital recordings and he created the Kawasaki Synthesizer for the Commodore 64.  During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands.  In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City where he settled and worked with Gil Evans, Elvin Jones, Chico Hamilton, Ted Curson, Joanne Brackeen amongst others.  In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers.  He also produced several techno dance singles, formed his own record company called Satellites Records, and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991. Stoner rock or stoner metal is a rock music fusion genre that combines elements of heavy metal and/or doom metal with psychedelic rock and acid rock.  The name references cannabis consumption.  The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \"stoner rock\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \"desert rock\".  Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \"retro\" production.  The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. Baroque pop (or baroque rock) is a fusion genre that combines rock music with particular elements of classical music.  It emerged in the mid 1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles (contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures.  Harpsichords figure prominently, while oboes, French horns, and string quartets are also common. The Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance was an award given to a song or album for excellence in the jazz fusion genre, a combination of rock and jazz.  It was given at the Grammy Awards, which began in 1958 under the name Gramophone Awards. Fiction in the '70s brought a return of old-fashioned storytelling, especially with Erich Segal's \"Love Story\".  The early seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as Saul Bellow and Peter De Vries, both of whom released poorly received novels at the start of the decade, but rebounded critically as the decade wore on.  Racism remained a key literary subject.  John Updike emerged as a major literary figure with his 1971 novel \"Rabbit Redux\".  Reflections of the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of Joyce Carol Oates and Wright Morris.  With the rising cost of hardcover books and the increasing readership of \"genre fiction\", the paperback became a popular medium.  Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic.  Irreverence and satire, typified in Kurt Vonnegut's \"Breakfast of Champions\", were common literary elements.  The horror genre also emerged, and by the late seventies Stephen King had become one of the most popular novelists in America, a coveted position he maintained in the following decade. Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock.  The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music.  The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal.  Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. Crunkcore (also called crunk punk, crunk rock, screamo-crunk, and scrunk) is a fusion genre characterized by the combination of cultural and musical elements from crunk, screamo, and emo.  The genre often features screamed vocals, dance-pop beats, and \"sexually provocative lyrics.\"", "com_question": "In what decade did \"School is Cool,\" a song in the fusion genre, emerge?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_146", "context": "The Volcano School refers to a group of non-native Hawaiian artists who painted dramatic nocturnal scenes of Hawaii's erupting volcanoes.  Some of the artists also produced watercolors, which, by the nature of the medium, tended to be diurnal.  At their best, these paintings exemplify a fusion of the European Sublime aesthetic, Romantic landscapes, and the American landscape traditions.  Two volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, were intermittently active during the 1880s and 1890s, when interest in Volcano School paintings peaked.  Getting to Kilauea, the more frequently painted volcano required an arduous two- or three-day roundtrip journey on horseback. A Hawaiian eruption is a type of volcanic eruption where lava flows from the vent in a relatively gentle, low level eruption; it is so named because it is characteristic of Hawaiian volcanoes.  Typically they are effusive eruptions, with basaltic magmas of low viscosity, low content of gases, and high temperature at the vent.  Very little amounts of volcanic ash are produced.  This type of eruption occurs most often at hotspot volcanoes such as Kīlauea on Hawaii's big island and in Iceland, though it can occur near subduction zones (e.g. Medicine Lake Volcano in California, United States) and rift zones.  Another example of Hawaiian eruptions occurred on the island of Surtsey in Iceland from 1964 to 1967, when molten lava flowed from the crater to the sea. Kaena Ridge, also referred to as the Kaena Volcano, is a submerged remnant of an ancient shield volcano that is to the north of and once comprised the northern section of the Hawaiian Island of Oʻ ahu.  Ka'ena Ridge was the oldest of the three volcanoes to form Oahu and it was also the shortest when it grew out of sea level.  It was about 3,000 ft. Lōʻihi Seamount (also known as Loihi) is an active submarine volcano about 35 km off the southeast coast of the island of Hawaiʻi.  The top of the seamount is about 975 m below sea level.  This seamount is on the flank of Mauna Loa, the largest shield volcano on Earth.  Lōʻihi, meaning \"long\" in Hawaiian, is the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, a string of volcanoes that stretches over 5800 km northwest of Lōʻihi.  Unlike most active volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean that make up the active plate margins on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Lōʻihi and the other volcanoes of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from the nearest plate boundary.  Volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands arise from the Hawaiʻi hotspot, and as the youngest volcano in the chain, Lōʻihi is the only Hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine preshield stage of development. Haleakalā ( ; Hawaiian: ] ), or the East Maui Volcano, is a massive shield volcano that forms more than 75% of the Hawaiian Island of Maui.  The western 25% of the island is formed by another volcano, Mauna Kahalawai, also referred to as the West Maui Mountains. The fish species of Hawaii inhabit the Hawaiian archipelago in the central North Pacific Ocean, southwest of the continental United States, southeast of Japan, and northeast of Australia.  The islands are part of the State of Hawaii, United States.  The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic Hawaiian Island chain, which comprises hundreds of islands spread over 1500 mi .  At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight \"main islands\" are (from the northwest to southeast) Niʻ ihau, Kauaʻ i, Oʻ ahu, Molokaʻ i, Lānaʻ i, Kahoʻ olawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻ i.  The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands include many atolls, and reefs. Due to Hawaii's isolation 30% of the fish are endemic (unique to the island chain). Maui Nui or Greater Maui, is a modern geologists' name given to a prehistoric Hawaiian Island built from seven shield volcanoes.  \"Nui\" means \"great/large\" in the Hawaiian language. Amasing Hill (Indonesian: Bukit Amasing ) consists of three small andesitic volcanoes.  The volcanic complex is located on Bacan island at the west of Halmahera island, Indonesia.  The two volcanoes, Cakasuanggi and Dua Saudara, were constructed in the southeast.  The other volcano, Sibela Mountains, is a metamorphic complex of volcano. The island of Maui ( ; Hawaiian: ] ) is the second-largest of the Hawaiian Islands at 727.2 square miles (1,883 km) and is the 17th-largest island in the United States.  Maui is part of the State of Hawaii and is the largest of Maui County's four islands, which include Molokaʻ i, Lānaʻ i, and unpopulated Kahoʻ olawe.  In 2010, Maui had a population of 144,444, third-highest of the Hawaiian Islands, behind that of Oʻ ahu and Hawaiʻ i Island.  Kahului is the largest census-designated place (CDP) on the island with a population of 26,337 as of 2010 and is the commercial and financial hub of the island.  Wailuku is the seat of Maui County and is the third-largest CDP as of 2010 .

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote Symphony No. 30 in D major, K. 202/186b in Salzburg, completing it on May 5, 1774. Joseph Haydn wrote Symphony No. 23 in G major, Hoboken I/23, in 1764. Anton Bruckner's “Study” Symphony in F minor (Studiensymphonie), WAB 99, was written in 1863 as an exercise under Otto Kitzler's instruction in form and orchestration.  Scholars at first believed that the next symphony Bruckner wrote was the so-called Symphony No. 0, thus this symphony is sometimes called Symphony No. 00 in F minor.  In any case, musicologists are sure now that the next symphony Bruckner wrote after this one was Symphony No. 1 in C minor.  Together with the Linz version of Symphony No. 1, the Study Symphony was not written in Vienna like all Bruckner's other symphonies. Joseph Haydn wrote Symphony No. 36 in E♭ major, Hoboken 1/36, some time in the first half of the 1760s.  Scored for 2 oboes, bassoon, 2 horns, strings and continuo, the slow movement features solos for violin and cello.  It is in four movements: An unfinished symphony is a fragment of a symphony, by a particular composer, that musicians and academics consider incomplete or unfinished for various reasons.  The archetypal unfinished symphony is Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (sometimes called \"Schubert's Unfinished Symphony\"), written in 1822, six years before his death.  It features two fully orchestrated movements.  While it seems clear from sketches that Schubert set out to create a traditional four-movement symphony, this has been the subject of endless debate.  Schubert wrote the symphony for the Graz Musical Society, and gave the manuscript to his friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner, in his capacity as its representative.  However, Hüttenbrenner did not show the score to the society at that time, nor did he reveal the existence of the manuscript after Schubert died in 1828, but kept it a secret for another 37 years.  In 1865, when he was 76 (three years before his death), Hüttenbrenner finally showed it to the conductor Johann von Herbeck, who conducted the extant two movements on 17 December 1865 in Vienna, adding the last movement of Schubert's third symphony as the finale.  Music historians and scholars then toiled to \"prove\" the composition was complete in its two-movement form, and indeed, in that form it became one of the most popular pieces in the late 19th century classical music repertoire, and remains one of Schubert's most popular compositions. Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 37 in D major, Perger 29, Sherman 37, MH 476, written in Salzburg in 1788, is the last D major symphony he wrote, the fourth of his final set of six symphonies. Bariah or Baptism for the Dead is only mentioned in .  This expression as used by the apostle may be equivalent to saying, \"He who goes through a baptism of blood in order to join a glorified church which has no existence [i.e., if the dead rise not] is a fool.\"  Some also regard the statement here as an allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at Corinth, in which a person was baptized in the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would be extended.  This they think may have been one of the erroneous customs which Paul went to Corinth to \"set in order.\" Rebaptism in Christianity is the baptism of a person who has previously been baptized, usually in association with a denomination that does not recognize the validity of the previous baptism.  When a denomination rebaptizes members of another denomination, it is a sign of significant differences in theology.  Churches that practice exclusive adult baptism, including Baptists, Churches of Christ and Christian Churches, rebaptize those who were baptized as infants because they do not consider infant baptism to be valid. Disparity of worship or disparity of cult (\"Disparitas Cultus\") is a diriment impediment in Roman Catholic canon law: a reason why a marriage can not be validly contracted without a dispensation, stemming from one person being certainly baptized, and the other certainly not baptized.", "com_question": "What is the date of Symphony No. 37?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_148", "context": "The Looney House is a historic residence near Ashville, Alabama.  The house was built in 1818 by Henry Looney and his father John.  Henry Looney was a veteran of the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and Fort Strother under the command of Andrew Jackson.  The house was built near the creek 7 mi from the city of Ashville.  In 1820, it was moved further up the hill along the creek as a result of the large amount of mosquitoes in the area during the summer time being an unbearable annoyance to the family.  Jane Rutherford, daughter of John and Peggy Ash (for whom Ashville was named), married Henry Looney in 1838. Horseshoe Bend National Military Park is a U.S. national military park managed by the National Park Service that is the site of the last battle of the Creek War on March 27, 1814.  General Andrew Jackson's Tennessee militia, aided by the 39th U.S. Infantry Regiment and Cherokee and Lower Creek allies, finally crushed Upper Creek Red Stick resistance during the Battle of Horseshoe Bend at this site on the Tallapoosa River.  Jackson's decisive victory at Horseshoe Bend broke the power of the Creek Nation. The Treaty of Fort Jackson (also known as the Treaty with the Creeks, 1814) was signed on August 9, 1814 at Fort Jackson near Wetumpka, Alabama following the defeat of the Red Stick (Upper Creek) resistance by United States allied forces at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.  It occurred on the banks of the Tallapoosa River near the present city of Alexander City, Alabama.  The U.S. force, led by General Andrew Jackson, consisted mainly of the West Tennessee Militia and 39th United States Infantry, allied with several groups of Cherokee and Lower Creek friendly to the American side.  The Upper Creek were led by Chief Menawa, who fled with hundreds of survivors into Florida, where they allied with the Seminole.  The surrender ended the Creek War, which the United States was fighting simultaneously with the War of 1812. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (also known as \"Tehopeka\", \"Tohopeka\", \"Cholocco Litabixbee\", or \"The Horseshoe\"), was fought during the War of 1812 in the Mississippi Territory, now central Alabama.  On March 27, 1814, United States forces and Indian allies under Major General Andrew Jackson defeated the Red Sticks, a part of the Creek Indian tribe who opposed American expansion, effectively ending the Creek War. Horseshoe Bend is a city in Fulton, Izard, and Sharp counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas.  The population was 2,184 at the 2010 census.  It is named for the large loop or horseshoe bend in the nearby Strawberry River. Lemuel Purnell Montgomery (c. 1786 – March 27, 1814) was an American military officer who fought in the Creek War.  Montgomery was an attorney in Nashville, Tennessee, when the War of 1812 broke out, and was commissioned as a major of the 39th Infantry.  He was killed in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, at the conclusion of the Creek War, on March 27, 1814. Dudleyville, also known as Pittsborough, is an unincorporated community in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, United States.  Dudleyville was named for Peter Dudley, who established the first trading post in the area.  The town was incorporated on February 2, 1839.  A post office was operated in Dudleyville from 1836 to 1907.  Major Lemuel Montgomery, the first American soldier killed in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, was formerly buried in the Dudleyville cemetery, before his grave was moved to Horseshoe Bend National Military Park.  Abram Mordecai, a trader who installed the first cotton gin in Alabama, lived for a time in Dudleyville.  It was here that Albert J. Pickett visited him in 1847 and gathered information from him to use in his \"History of Alabama\".  County Line Baptist Church, which is located east of Dudleyville, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Horseshoe Bend is an inner city suburb in the City of Maitland in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia.  It is named for the shape made by the Hunter River flowing through the area as it was observed by early European settlers.  It is sometimes colloquially referred to by residents as \"The Bend\".  One of the earliest settled areas in Maitland, it is characterised by narrow streets and laneways, as well as a mixture of architectural styles spanning the 19th and 20th centuries.  The suburb was amongst the worst affected areas in the 1955 Hunter Valley floods, with the loss of many homes, leading to a decline in its popularity as a residential area.  Maitland City Council planning strategies have identified Horseshoe Bend as a future growth area, outlining flood mitigation measures and evacuation plans to protect residents. Carl Friedrich Theodor Strehlow (23 December 1871 – 20 October 1922), linguist, anthropologist, genealogist, collector of natural history specimens, missionary and translator, served on two Lutheran missions in inland Australia from May 1892 to October 1922, a total of thirty years.  He was at the first mission station, Killalpaninna (often referred to as Bethesda), from 1892 to 1894, and the second, Hermannsburg, eighty miles west of Alice Springs, from 1894 to 1922, first as teacher and, from 1901 onwards, manager, and it is for his work here that he is mostly known today.  Strehlow was ably assisted and supported by his wife Friederike Johanna Henriette Keysser (31 August 1875 – 30 April 1957), who played the central role in reducing the high infant mortality which threatened Aboriginal communities all over Australia after the onset of white settlement.  It is probable that Hermannsburg was the only Mission in Australia at the start of the twentieth century where the population was growing through natural increase.  As a polymath with an interest in natural history, through his Aranda informants Strehlow provided plant and animal specimens to museums in Germany and Australia, a number of which first came to scientific notice through his collecting.  This was the outcome of his collaboration with Moritz, Baron von Leonhardi of Gross Karben in Hessen, Germany, who also suggested he write his monumental anthropological work Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral-Australien (The Aranda and Loritja Tribes in Central Australia).  With Leonhardi as editor this work became the first publication of the newly founded Städtisches Völkermuseum (Municipal Ethnological Museum) of Frankfurt am Main, appearing in eight parts between 1907 and 1920.  Strehlow sent what was said to be the best collection in the world of Aboriginal artefacts – both sacred and secular – to Frankfurt, unfortunately largely destroyed in the bombing of the city in World War Two, though some fine pieces remain.  Due to Leonhardi’s sudden death in 1910, Strehlow’s linguistic researches intended as part of Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme were never published, though used in manuscript form by his son Theodor George Henry Strehlow and later Hermannsburg missionaries.  Strehlow also collaborated on the pioneering first complete translation of the New Testament into an Aboriginal language (Dieri), published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1897, and he later translated the New Testament into Aranda, parts of which were published after his death.  He also produced a reader and service book in the latter language.  Falling ill with dropsy in September 1922, he tried to reach a doctor but died at Horseshoe Bend halfway between Alice Springs and Oodnadatta, leaving Frieda and fourteen-year-old son Theodor to continue south to Adelaide without him.  Professor TGH Strehlow, who is better known than Carl, built his scholarly career in part on the researches carried out by his father. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend, also referred to as the Battle of Pecatonica and the Battle of Bloody Lake, was fought on June 16, 1832 in present-day Wisconsin at an oxbow lake known as \"Horseshoe Bend\", which was formed by a change in course of the Pecatonica River.  The battle was a major turning point in the Black Hawk War, despite being of only minor military significance.  The small victory won by the U.S. militia at Horseshoe Bend helped restore public confidence in the volunteer force following an embarrassing defeat at Stillman's Run.  The Battle of Horseshoe Bend ended with three militia men killed in action and a party of eleven Kickapoo warriors dead.", "com_question": "What language did the warriors at Horseshoe Bend speak, where is Horseshoe Bend located, and what year did the battle take place?", "com_reference": "The warriors at Horseshoe Bend spoke the Aboriginal language of Aranda.

The film was released to much acclaim and earned numerous accolades from film critics and guilds.  Ultimately, it received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, winning two for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Penn and Best Original Screenplay for Black. Harvey Milk is an American experimental rock/noise rock band that formed in Athens, Georgia in the early 1990s.  While Harvey Milk invariably draws comparisons to the Melvins, due to their penchant for slow, heavy riffs, the band has touched upon such artists as ZZ Top, Led Zeppelin, Leonard Cohen, and Kiss as influences in their music.  They even went so far as to perform a live show consisting of nothing but Hank Williams covers.  One April Fool's Day gig at the 40 Watt in Athens, they performed R.E.M.'s \"Reckoning\" album from beginning to end, while Michael Stipe was in attendance.

Gaye's first album to chart was a duet album with Mary Wells titled \"Together\", peaking at number forty-two on the Billboard pop album chart.  His 1965 album, \"Moods of Marvin Gaye\", became his first album to reach the top ten of the R&B album charts and spawned four hit singles.  Gaye recorded more than thirty hit singles for Motown throughout the 1960s, becoming established as \"the Prince of Motown\".  Gaye topped the charts in 1968 with his rendition of \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", while his 1969 album, \"M.P.G.\", became his first number one R&B album.  Gaye's landmark album, 1971's \"What's Going On\" became the first album by a solo artist to launch three top ten singles, including the title track.  His 1973 single, \"Let's Get It On\", topped the charts while its subsequent album reached number two on the charts becoming his most successful Motown album to date.  In 1982, after 21 years with Motown, Gaye signed with Columbia Records and issued \"Midnight Love\", which included his most successful single to date, \"Sexual Healing\".

Chisholm Trail was a trail in the post American Civil War era to drive cattle overland from ranches in Texas to Kansas railheads. The McGranahan Portion of the Chisholm Trail Roadbed is a remnant of the Chisholm Trail, a cattle trail that ran north-south between Texas and Kansas through the Indian Territory.  It is the only portion of the Chisholm Trail through Oklahoma listed on the National Register. Chisholm Spring was a small trading post in Oklahoma Territory, two miles east of present-day Asher, Oklahoma.  The post was established by frontier cattleman Jesse Chisholm (for whom the famous Chisholm Trail was named ) in 1847.  The settlement attracted many plains Indians, but efforts to create a town were aborted when Chisholm moved to Kansas in 1862. The Great Western Cattle Trail was used during the 19th century for movement of cattle and horses to markets in eastern and northern states.  The trail was also known as the Western Trail, Fort Griffin Trail, Dodge City Trail, Northern Trail and Texas Trail.  It replaced the Chisholm trail when it closed.  While it wasn't as well known, it was greater in length, reaching rail-heads up in Kansas and Nebraska and carried longhorns and horses to stock open-range ranches in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana, and two provinces in Canada.

In his book, he argued for a much more generous peace, not out of a desire for justice or fairness – these are aspects of the peace that Keynes does not deal with – but for the sake of the economic well-being of all of Europe, including the Allied Powers, which the Treaty of Versailles and its associated treaties would prevent. Neo-Keynesian economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that was developed in the post-war period from the writings of John Maynard Keynes.  A group of economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson), attempted to interpret and formalize Keynes' writings, and to synthesize it with the neo-classical models of economics.  Their work has become known as the neo-classical synthesis, and created the models that formed the core ideas of neo-Keynesian economics.  These ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post-war period, and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Keynes: The Return of the Master is a 2009 book by economic historian Robert Skidelsky.  The work discusses the economic theories and philosophy of John Maynard Keynes, and argues about their relevance to the world following the Financial crisis of 2007–2010.  In contrast to the 30 years he needed to write his prize winning biography on Keynes, the author was able to write this 240 page book in only three months. John Neville Keynes ( ; 31 August 1852 – 15 November 1949) was a British economist and father of John Maynard Keynes. The Life of John Maynard Keynes is a non-fiction work by Roy Harrod, about the life of John Maynard Keynes.  It was first published in 1951.  A paperback edition was published in 1983.  The paperback edition of Harrod’s authorized biography of Keynes runs 708 pages.  According to the preface of the book, Harrod was solicited by Keynes’s younger brother, the scholar Geoffrey Keynes, to write the biography and thus had full access to Keynes' personal papers and his family.  Harrod’s biography does not include any unflattering or controversial aspects of Keynes' life. In macroeconomics, the Keynes–Ramsey rule is an optimality condition for the rate of change of consumption.  Usually it is a differential equation relating consumption with interest rates, time preference, and (intertemporal) elasticity of substitution.  The Keynes–Ramsey rule is named after Frank P. Ramsey, who derived it in 1928, and his mentor John Maynard Keynes, who provided an economic interpretation. The Sraffa–Hayek debate is debate between Piero Sraffa and Friedrich Hayek in 1930s.  In 1931, Hayek critiqued John Maynard Keynes's \"Treatise on Money\" (1930) in his \"Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J. M. Keynes\" and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as \"Prices and Production\".  Keynes replied to Hayek.  After this, Keynes asked Sraffa to write a critical review of \"Prices and Production\" for the Economic Journal.  Sraffa elaborated on the logical inconsistencies of Hayek's argument, especially concerning the effect of inflation-induced \"forced savings\" on the capital sector and about the definition of a \"natural\" interest rate in a growing economy.  Hayek's response and Sraffa's rejoinder was published after this. The Cambridge Circus or Keynes's Circus was a group of young Cambridge economists closely associated with John Maynard Keynes.  The group consisted of Richard Kahn, James Meade, Joan Robinson, Austin Robinson, and Piero Sraffa.  The Circus formed immediately following the 31 October 1930 publication of Keynes's \"A Treatise on Money\".  The group met to read and discuss the \"Treatise\" and to provide feedback on Keynes's continuing theoretical work that would lead to his \"General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\".  Sraffa initiated the group, which met in Kahn's rooms of the Gibb's Building at King's College.  The Circus met among themselves and in a seminar, which included some undergraduates, during the 1930-1931 academic year.  The seminar convened in the Old Combination Room of Trinity College. A Guide to Keynes is a non-fiction work by Alvin Hansen, about the life of John Maynard Keynes.  It was first published in 1953.  Hansen’s guide, 237 pages long, seeks to explain Keynes’s General Theory chapter by chapter in a fashion more accessible to a beginner.  Alvin Hansen,once referred to as \"the American Keynes\", had brought the 1930s Keynesian economics revolution, along with other economists, to the United States. Lydia Lopokova, Baroness Keynes (born Lidia Vasilyevna Lopukhova) (Russian: Ли́дия Васи́льевна Лопухо́ва ; 21 October 1892 – 8 June 1981) was a famous Russian ballerina during the early 20th century.

The Battle of Imphal took place in the region around the city of Imphal, the capital of the state of Manipur in northeast India from March until July 1944.  Japanese armies attempted to destroy the Allied forces at Imphal and invade India, but were driven back into Burma with heavy losses.  Together with the simultaneous Battle of Kohima on the road by which the encircled Allied forces at Imphal were relieved, the battle was the turning point of the Burma Campaign, part of the South-East Asian Theatre of the Second World War.  The defeat at Kohima and Imphal was the largest defeat to that date in Japanese history. The Battle of the Tennis Court was part of the Battle of Kohima in North East India from April 4 – June 22, 1944 during the Burma Campaign of the Second World War.  The Japanese advance into India was halted at Kohima in April 1944 and Garrison Hill, on a long wooded ridge on a high ridge west of the village, was the scene of perhaps the most bitter fighting of the whole Burma campaign when a small Commonwealth force held out against repeated attacks by a Japanese Division.  The fiercest hand-to-hand fighting took place in the garden of the Deputy Commissioner's bungalow, around the Tennis Court. The U Go offensive, or Operation C (ウ号作戦), was the Japanese offensive launched in March 1944 against forces of the British Empire in the northeast Indian regions of Manipur and the Naga Hills (then administered as part of Assam).  Aimed at the Brahmaputra valley, through the two towns of Imphal and Kohima, the offensive along with the overlapping Ha Go offensive was one of the last major Japanese offensives during the Second World War.  The offensive culminated in the Battles of Imphal and Kohima, where the Japanese and their allies were first held and then pushed back. Between 1942 and 1945, the INA was involved in various military operations fighting alongside the Japanese forces and against the British and Allied forces.  They are notable for their contributions to the battle fought in Burma, Imphal and Kohima. Tangkhul Hundung is a village located south of Ukhrul in Ukhrul district, Manipur state, India.

The Azad Hind Dal was a branch of the Indian Independence League that was formed during World War II to take administrative control of the Indian territories to fall to the Indian National Army starting with the latter's Imphal campaign.  The branch was created by Subhas Chandra Bose to replace the Indian Civil Service in areas of British India, and is also thought to have been the nascent concept of a one-party political, bureaucractic and civil administrative system similar to that of the Soviet Union or the Fascist states of the time.  During the brief period that Azad Hind was in possession of small Indian territories around Imphal and Kohima during the U Go offensive between April and May 1944, parties of the Azad Hind Dal were sent along with the INA contingents to take administrative charge and rehabilitation of these areas. The Battle of Kohima was the turning point of the Japanese U Go offensive into India in 1944 during the Second World War.  The battle was fought in three stages from 4 April to 22 June 1944 around the town of Kohima in Nagaland in northeast India.  From 3 to 16 April, the Japanese attempted to capture Kohima ridge, a feature which dominated the road by which the besieged British and Indian troops of IV Corps at Imphal were supplied.  By mid-April, the small British and Indian force at Kohima was relieved.  From 18 April to 13 May, British and Indian reinforcements counter-attacked to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured.  The Japanese abandoned the ridge at this point but continued to block the Kohima–Imphal road.  From 16 May to 22 June, the British and Indian troops pursued the retreating Japanese and reopened the road.

The highway is known by several designations along its routing, primarily New York State Route 27A (NY 27A) from the county line to Oakdale and NY 27 east of Southampton.  The portion of Montauk Highway between Oakdale and Southampton is mostly county-maintained as County Route 80 and County Route 85 (CR 80 and CR 85, respectively). Route 112 is a busy east/west highway on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada.  Its eastern terminus is in Frampton at the junction of Route 275, and the western terminus is in Downtown Montreal (at the corner of Peel Street and Sherbrooke Street), after crossing the Victoria Bridge.  The stretch between Vallée-Jonction and Sherbrooke is a very busy highway as it is the main link between the southern regions of Quebec, in particular the Beauce region and the Eastern Townships.  Between Sherbrooke and Marieville there is less traffic, since Autoroute 10 is in close proximity to the highway.  (Before Autoroute 10 was put in service in the early 1960s, Route 1 (now Route 112) was the main link between Montreal and the Eastern Townships; see paragraph below.)  From Marieville to Montreal it is a very busy highway, in most parts a four-lane separated highway, upgraded to freeway standards in certain places. Route 112 is a rural highway through western Franklin and Hampshire Counties.  It begins at U.S. Route 20 in Huntington and ends at the Vermont state line in Colrain, where it continues as Vermont Route 112. Medford is a station in the hamlet of Medford, New York on the Main Line (Greenport Branch) of the Long Island Rail Road.  Medford is located on New York State Route 112 between Peconic Avenue and Long Island Avenue.  Access to the station is available from a narrow curving roadway leading off Route 112.  This roadway used to connect with the Ohio Avenue intersection until Ohio Avenue was closed north of Peconic Avenue in 2007.  It is also accessible from the north end of Oregon Avenue, although the Medford Fire Department periodically closes the Oregon Avenue access road for drills or other exercises. Vermont Route 112 is a short state highway in southern Vermont, United States.  It is a continuation of Massachusetts Route 112, running from the state line in Halifax north to an intersection with Vermont Route 100 in the village of Jacksonville.

Port Jefferson is the terminus for the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road.  The station is located on New York State Route 25A (Main Street), on the north side of the tracks, but is also accessible from Oakland Avenue (both of which are in the Village of Port Jefferson), as well as Railroad Avenue and Union Street on the south side of the tracks in Port Jefferson Station.  All service is diesel-only, and most off-peak trains are shuttles requiring a transfer to an electric train at Huntington or Hicksville.  This train station is located in the Brookhaven-Comsewogue Union Free School District. The Port Jefferson Branch is a rail line and service owned and operated by the Long Island Rail Road in the U.S. state of New York.  The branch splits from the Main Line just east of Hicksville and runs northeast and east to Port Jefferson.  Several stations on the Main Line west of Hicksville are served primarily by trains bound to/from the Port Jefferson branch, so LIRR maps and schedules for the public include that part of the Main Line in the \"Port Jefferson Branch\" service. Bicycle Path is a historic road in Central Suffolk County on Long Island, New York, built in the late 19th Century in order to capitalize on the bicycle craze of that period.  It ran north and south from Patchogue to just east of Port Jefferson, lying mostly west of New York State Route 112, crossing it at Port Jefferson Road in Port Jefferson Station. New York State Route 112 (NY 112) is a state highway located entirely within the town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, New York, in the United States.  It runs from an intersection with Montauk Highway (formerly part of NY 27A) in the village of Patchogue to a junction with NY 25A in Port Jefferson Station.  It is known locally as Medford Avenue in Patchogue and Patchogue Road in Terryville and Port Jefferson Station.  The official name for the road outside these areas is \"Patchogue–Port Jefferson Road\", though it is often signed simply as \"Route 112\". New York State Route 27 (NY 27) is an east–west 120.58 mi long state highway extending from Interstate 278 (I-278) in the New York City borough of Brooklyn to Montauk Point State Park on Long Island, New York, in the United States.  Its two most prominent components are Sunrise Highway and Montauk Highway, the latter of which includes the Montauk Point State Parkway.  East of the interchange with the Heckscher State Parkway in Islip Terrace, NY 27 acts as the primary east–west highway on southern Long Island.  The entire route in Suffolk, Nassau, and Queens counties was designated by the New York State Senate as the POW/MIA Memorial Highway.  Every town on the South Shore is accessible through Sunrise Highway.  The service roads that parallel the highway from Farmingdale to Brookhaven are officially designated, but not signed, as New York State Route 906C and New York State Route 906D.", "com_question": "How many people live in Port Jefferson Station?

The Bronx Lyceum was a New York City landmark erected on the southeast corner of Third Avenue and 170th Street by Henry Zeltner in 1870 across the street from his brewery.  The structure was at first known as Zeltner's Hall and was surrounded by a picnic park.  Following the sale of the entertainment and meeting hall by the Zeltner family, the property was called Niblo's Garden, a familiar name borrowed from an early New York opera house on Broadway, near Prince Street that was razed in 1895.  The building was used as a meeting hall by politicians and union members, and served variously as an entertainment hall, skating venue, and amusement park until its destruction by fire in 1929. The Olivenhain Town Meeting Hall is a community meeting house located at 423 Rancho Santa Fe Rd. in Olivenhain, California.  The wood frame building was constructed from 1894 to 1895 by the settlers of Olivenhain.

Almost every important event in the community's history took place in the hall, and one author called the building \"the nerve center of Olivenhain\".  An annex was added to the hall in 1916, using redwood from a second meeting hall which had fallen into disrepair.

Ron Hubbard, the pulp fiction author who created Scientology.  Church-connected groups promoting aspects of L.

There have also been groups practising Scientology independently of the Church. Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics, sometimes referred to as The Brainwashing Manual, is a book published by the Church of Scientology in 1955.  It purports to be a condensation of the work of Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief.  The book states Kenneth Goff as author.  Its true authorship is not clear, the three common hypotheses being: Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, Kenneth Goff (alias Oliver Kenneth Goff), or both L Ron Hubbard and Kenneth Goff based on an acquired US agency report.  The third hypothesis is questionable as there is not proof that the two men ever knew each other.  Claims that L Ron Hubbard was the author are also dubious as the only source of this claim is his estranged son, L Ron Hubbard Jr., who made it his life work trying to intentionally discredit his father in every possible way, and in addition to withdrawing all his accusations before his death, has been discredited in courts of law. Robert Ludlum (1927–2001) was an American author of twenty-seven novels between 1971 and 2006, the last being issued five years after his death.

Ludlum also created the \"Covert-One\" series, overseeing the first three novels with Gayle Lynds and Philip Shelby before his death.  Following Ludlum's death, his estate has continued to publish novels under his name with eight authors having written a combined twenty-two novels under the Ludlum brand, a trademark inscription of \"Robert Ludlum's\" on every book (e.g. \"Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Dominion\").  Since 2007, publishing rights in the United States have been held by Grand Central Publishing, taking over from St. Martin's Press who held the rights from 2000 to 2006.

The game was released in North America on June 3, June 5 in Australia and June 27, 2008 in Europe. Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard is a posthumous biography of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard by British journalist Russell Miller.  First published in the United Kingdom on 26 October 1987, the book takes a critical perspective, challenging the Church of Scientology's account of Hubbard's life and work.  It quotes extensively from official documents acquired using the Freedom of Information Act and from Hubbard's personal papers, which were obtained via a defector from the Church.  It was also published in Australia, Canada and the United States.

Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986), better known as L. Ron Hubbard ( ) and often referred to by his initials, LRH, was an American author and the founder of the Church of Scientology.  After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories, he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950.  He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology.  His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.  The Church's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the most translated and published author in the world.  The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard.  In 2014, Hubbard was cited by \"Smithsonian\" magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time, as one of the eleven religious figures on that list. L.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_170", "context": "The Targum Sheni (\"\"Second Targum\"\") is an Aramaic translation (\"targum\") and elaboration of the Book of Esther, that embellishes the Biblical account with considerable new apocryphal material, not on the face of it directly germane to the Esther story.  Notable among these additions is an account of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, which sees the King commanding a daunting army of animals, birds and demonic spirits as subjects and the Queen demanding from him the answer to three riddles, before she will pay homage.  The Jewish Encyclopedia characterises the story as a \"genuine and exuberant midrash\", i.e. a free elaboration, of a kind not unusual in Rabbinic literature. The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is a book that gives a more detailed account of the reigns of the kings of ancient Kingdom of Israel than that presented in the Hebrew Bible, and may have been the source from which parts of the biblical account were drawn.  The book was likely compiled by or derived from the kings of Israel's own scribes, and is likely the source for the basic facts presented in the Bible, though the compiler(s) of the biblical text clearly made selective use of it and added commentaries and judgements. In the Abrahamic religions, Noah ( ; ; Syriac: ܢܘܚ‎ \"Nukh\"; Arabic: نُوح‎ ‎ \"Nūḥ \"; Ancient Greek: Νῶε ) was the tenth and last of the pre-flood Patriarchs.  The story of Noah's Ark is told in the Bible's Genesis flood narrative.  The biblical account is followed by the story of the Curse of Canaan. Adamah (Biblical Hebrew : אדמה) is a word, translatable as ground or earth, which occurs in the Biblical account of Creation of the Book of Genesis.  The etymological link between the word adamah and the word adam is used to reinforce the teleological link between humankind and the ground, emphasising both the way in which man was created to cultivate the world, and how he originated from the \"dust of the ground\".  Because man is both made from the adamah and inhabits it, his duty to realise his own potential is linked to a corresponding duty to the earth.  In Eden, the adamah has primarily positive connotations, although Adam's close relationship with the adamah has been interpreted as likening him to the serpent, which crawls upon the ground, thus emphasising his animal nature. José do Egito (English: \"Joseph from Egypt\") is a Brazilian miniseries produced and broadcast by RecordTV.  It premiered on January 30, 2013 and ended on October 9, 2013.

It was enacted as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 49 (Education) Section 1922, having been signed into law by Tennessee governor Austin Peay.  The law also prevented the teaching of the evolution of man from what it referred to as lower orders of animals in place of the Biblical account. Benebarak (\"Sons of Barak\") (Hebrew: בְּנֵי בְּרַק‎ ) was a biblical city mentioned in the Book of Joshua.  According to the biblical account it was allocated to the Tribe of Dan. The Exodus Decoded is a documentary film aired on April 16, 2006, on The History Channel.  The program was created by Israeli-Canadian filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici and the producer/director James Cameron.  (The two would later work together on \"The Lost Tomb of Jesus\".)  The documentary explores evidence for the Biblical account of the Exodus.  Its claims and methods were criticized by Biblical scholars and mainstream scientists. Hobah (Hebrew: חובה‎ ‎ ) was a biblical place mentioned only in Genesis 14:15.  When Abraham (then Abram) rescued his nephew Lot, the biblical account relates that he pursued his captors as far north as Hobah.  He pursued the four Kings who had pillaged Sodom and Gomorrah.  It is said to be North of Damascus in the Bible.  It is mentioned in the aftermath of the Battle of Siddim.

Eurasians in Singapore are individuals of mixed European and Asian descent.  Eurasians have been viewed with mixed fascination and disdain by the European and Asian communities.  Their European ancestry traces to emigrants of countries that span the length and breadth of Europe, although Eurasian migrants to Singapore in the 19th century came largely from other colonies in Asia, such as British Malaya in particular Malacca and Penang, India including Chittagong (today in Bangladesh) and Goa, the former Portuguese colony in India; the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina.  When the European maritime powers colonised Asian countries, such as India, Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Indonesia and Indochina, from the 16th to 20th centuries, they brought into being a new race of people known historically and generally as the Eurasians.  The early Western colonisers were not accompanied by their womenfolk on the perilous journey to Asia.  Consequently, many married the local women of these lands, or formed liaisons with them.  Initially the offspring of such a union were brought up as an appendage of the ruling class and enjoyed advantages not generally accorded the rest of the local Asian population.  In time, as colonial attitudes hardened due to the 1915 Singapore Mutiny and growing independence movement, Eurasians were largely cast aside by the colonial masters and treated much like the rest of the local population.

Nuclear criticality safety is a field of nuclear engineering dedicated to the prevention of nuclear and radiation accidents resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.  Additionally, nuclear criticality safety is concerned with mitigating the consequences of a nuclear criticality accident.  A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation.  Nuclear criticality safety practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials.  A common practice is to apply a double contingency analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur.  For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material.  Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis.  These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practicable, by administrative controls such as operating procedures, job instructions and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes that could lead to a nuclear criticality accident. The Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project is a project, somewhat along the lines of AMIP or CMIP, to coordinate and encourage the systematic study of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) and to assess their ability to simulate large climate changes such as those that occurred in the distant past.  Project goals include identifying common responses of AGCMs to imposed paleoclimate \"boundary conditions,\" understanding the differences in model responses, comparing model results with paleoclimate data, and providing AGCM results for use in helping in the analysis and interpretation of paleoclimate data.  PMIP is initially focussing on the mid-Holocene (6,000 years before present) and the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 yr BP) because climatic conditions were remarkably different at those times, and because relatively large amounts of paleoclimate data exist for these periods.  The major \"forcing\" factors are also relatively well known at these times.  Some of the paleoclimate features simulated by models in previous studies seem consistent with paleoclimatic data, but others do not.  One of the goals of PMIP is to determine which results are model-dependent.  The PMIP experiments are limited to studying the equilibrium response of the atmosphere (and such surface characteristics as snow cover) to changes in boundary conditions (e.g., insolation, ice-sheet distribution, CO concentration, etc.)  Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), also known as congenital analgesia, is one or more rare conditions in which a person cannot feel (and has never felt) physical pain.  The conditions described here are separate from the HSAN group of disorders, which have more specific signs and cause.  Because feeling physical pain is vital for survival, CIP is an extremely dangerous condition.  It is common for people with the condition to die in childhood due to injuries or illnesses going unnoticed.  Burn injuries are one of the more common injuries. An illusion costume is a costume that fools the eyes by making it seem that the person in the costume is riding an animal, being held by another person (which is part of the costume), or many other things.  The most common is the rider, in which the \"rider\" (person) gives the illusion of riding an animal; the person's legs go through the hollowed-out animal legs, along with fake legs dangling off the wearer's body to finish off the illusion. Diabetic neuropathies are nerve damaging disorders associated with diabetes mellitus.  These conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum) in addition to macrovascular conditions that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy.  Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy. A selenide is a chemical compound containing a selenium anion with oxidation number of −2 (Se), much as sulfur does in a sulfide.  The chemistry of the selenides and sulfides is similar.  Similar to sulfide, in aqueous solution, the selenide ion, Se, is prevalent only in very basic conditions.  In neutral conditions, hydrogen selenide ion, HSe, is most common.  In acid conditions, hydrogen selenide, HSe, is formed. The fitness-density covariance is a coexistence mechanism that can allow similar species to coexist because they are in different locations.  This effect will be the strongest if species are completely segregated, but can also work if their populations overlap somewhat.  If a fitness-density covariance is operating, then when a species becomes very rare, its population will shift to predominately locations with favorable conditions (e.g., less competition or good habitat).  Similarly, when a species becomes very common, then conditions will worsen where they are most common, and they will spread into areas where conditions are less favorable.  This negative feedback can help species avoid being driven extinct by competition, and it can prevent stronger species from becoming too common and crowding out other species. ASTM F 1915 is a standard test method for glazing for detention facilities.  This standard was created by the American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM).  ASTM International which was funded in 1898, is an international standards developing organization that develops and publishes standards for a wide range of materials, products, systems, and services.  This standard was published by ASTM F33 which is a committee specializes about detention and correctional facilities.  FM 33 has published 14 standards in this area.

The United Kingdom was represented by the British Olympic Association (BOA), and the team of selected athletes was also known as Team GB.  British athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympic Games of the modern era, alongside Australia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, though Great Britain is the only country to have won at least one gold medal at all of them.  Although the British Olympic Association is the National Olympic Committee (NOC) for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Northern Irish athletes can choose whether to compete for Great Britain or for the Republic of Ireland, as they are entitled to citizenship of either nation under the Good Friday Agreement.  In 2016 Northern Ireland born representatives in Team GB included returning rowers Alan Campbell, Peter Chambers and Richard Chambers, archer Patrick Huston and four members of the men's field hockey team: David Ames, Mark Gleghorne, Iain Lewers and Ian Sloan.  The team also represents, and included representation from, the Crown dependencies, among which were Guernsey's Heather Watson and Carl Hester, and from the ten of the thirteen British Overseas Territories represented by the BOA rather than their own NOC, whose representatives include Turks and Caicos-born sprinter Delano Williams and Anguillan-born long jumper Shara Proctor The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established as a sovereign state on 1 January 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland.  The growing desire for an Irish Republic led to the Irish War of Independence, which resulted in Ireland seceding from the Union and forming the Irish Free State in 1922.  Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and the state was consequently renamed the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". The Glorious Twelfth is a term used usually to refer to 12 August, the start of the shooting season for red grouse (\"Lagopus lagopus scotica\"), and to a lesser extent the ptarmigan (\"Lagopus muta\") in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is one of the busiest days in the shooting season, with large amounts of game being shot.  The date itself is traditional; the current legislation enshrining it in England and Wales is the Game Act 1831 (and in Northern Ireland, the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985).  Not all game (as defined by the 1831 act) have the same start to their open seasons - most begin on 1 September, with 1 October for woodcock and pheasant. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) and colloquially Great Britain (GB) or simply Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.  Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, the United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands.  Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland.  Apart from this land border, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.  The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland.  With an area of 242500 km2 , the United Kingdom is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.  It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants.  Together, this makes it the fourth-most densely populated country in the European Union (EU). A monarchical system of government existed in Ireland from ancient times until, for what became the Republic of Ireland, the mid-twentieth century.  Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, remains under a monarchical system of government.  The Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland ended with the Norman invasion of Ireland, when the kingdom became a fief of the Holy See under the Lordship of the King of England.  This lasted until the Parliament of Ireland conferred the crown of Ireland upon King Henry VIII of England during the English Reformation.  The monarch of England held the crowns of England and Ireland in a personal union.  The Union of the Crowns in 1603 expanded the personal union to include Scotland.  The personal union between England and Scotland became a political union with the enactments of the Acts of Union 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain.  The crowns of Great Britain and Ireland remained in personal union until it was ended by the Acts of Union 1800, which united Ireland and Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from January 1801 until December 1922. Irish migration to Great Britain has occurred from the earliest recorded history to the present.  There has been a continuous movement of people between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain due to their proximity.  This tide has ebbed and flowed in response to politics, economics and social conditions of both places.  Ireland was a feudal Lordship of the Kings of England between 1171 and 1541; a Kingdom in personal union with the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Great Britain between 1542 and 1801; and politically united with Great Britain as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1801 and 1922.  Today, Ireland is divided between the independent Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There have been 12 monarchs of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the United Kingdom (see Monarchy of the United Kingdom) since the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707.  England and Scotland had been in personal union under the House of Stuart since 24 March 1603.  On 1 January 1801, Great Britain merged with the Kingdom of Ireland (also previously in personal union with Great Britain) to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  After most of Ireland left the union on 6 December 1922, its name was amended on 12 April 1927 to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.  The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure.  This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution.  In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed. The Great Britain men's national basketball team, known as Great Britain or GB, is the national team for Great Britain in basketball.

Building on earlier work by scholars Robert DeMaria, Walter Jackson Bate, Lawrence Lipking and Peter Martin, many critics lauded \"Samuel Johnson: A Life\" as a significant step forward in Johnsonian biography and criticism.  In the biography, Nokes challenges James Boswell's significance in Dr. Johnson's life, writing that \"Johnson wished to keep...his acknowledged biographer at a distance\" and even second-guessed his \"annointment\" of Boswell as his official biographer. The Life of Samuel Johnson or \"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.  D.\" was written by John Hawkins in 1787.  It was the first full biography of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's \"A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson\" being the first short postmortem biography.  Hawkins was a friend of Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him.  After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works.  His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics.  Hawkins's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication.  Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances. Bennet Langton (  1736 – 1801) was an English writer and a founding member of the Literary Club.  He is best known for his close friendship with writer Samuel Johnson and his numerous appearances in James Boswell's book \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\". Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709 <nowiki>[</nowiki>OS 7 September]  – 13 December 1784), often referred to as Dr. Johnson, was an English writer who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer.  Johnson was a devout Anglican and committed Tory, and is described by the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" as \"arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history\".  He is also the subject of the biography, \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\" by James Boswell. Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of criticism of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt.  Composed in reaction to the neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, paved the way for the increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism.  It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader. Donald Johnson Greene (November 21, 1914 – May 13, 1997) was a literary critic, English professor, and scholar of British literature, particularly the eighteenth-century period.  Known especially for his work on Samuel Johnson, he also wrote on later authors such as Jane Austen, Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Donald Davie. The Hazlitt Theatre is one of the main theatres in Maidstone, Kent.  It was named after William Hazlitt, the famous essayist, who was born in Maidstone in 1778.  It opened in 1955.  It presents a varied programme of professional drama, comedy, music etc. as well as local community theatre groups.  This traditional proscenium arch theatre seats 353.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_226", "context": "The Ensoniq Fizmo was Ensoniq's last attempt at creating the perfect synthesizer.  Developed in 1998, the Fizmo uses a Digital Acoustic simulation Transwave with 4 MB of ROM, up to 4 voices per preset, each voice with 2 oscillators, independent lfos and FX: 48 voices maximum, with 3 separate fx units (24-bit VLSI effects with 41 algorithms) built in for further sound sculpting.  The Fizmo featured 61 keys, and responded to : velocity & after-touch, as well as allowing the sounds to be split by : velocity & keyboard.  The name F-I-Z-M-O was mapped across 5 real-time control knobs just above the keyboard keys, allowing real-time modulation of the waves for more user controlled evolving sounds than a usual synthesizer could provide, as well as also having 17 dedicated Sound and Effect editing knobs for further sound design and editing. The AX80 is a polyphonic analogue keyboard synthesizer manufactured by Akai Professional in 1984.  It was Akai's first venture into the professional electronic musical instrument market.  The AX80 used digitally controlled oscillators (DCO) and filter circuitry based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3372 integrated circuit.  It was marketed as part of a line of project studio equipment called the Akai Music Studio System, which included the S612 digital sampler the MR16 drum machine, the MS08 sequencer, and the MG1212 multitrack tape recorder, at a price of $1,695 US. The hogscraper candlestick is an early (circa 1780 - 1860) form of lighting device commonly used in 19th-century North America and Britain, and mainly manufactured in England.  The device is manufactured of tempered sheet iron, wrought in several pieces and joined together by metal joinery and silver soldering.  The name is derived from the candlestick's resemblance to an antique device used to scrape bristles from hog hide after slaughter.  The antique lighting device commonly consists of a shaft, attached to a round base with a thumb tab ejector mechanism to remove the residual candle stub, and a round lip or \"bobeche\" to collect candle drippings.  The \"bobeche\" often has a hook extension used for hanging the device. The Korg DSS-1 is a 12-bit polyphonic sampling synthesizer released in September 1986.  It came out at a time when many of the popular synthesizer companies were beginning to get into sampling, an area of sound design that had previously been left to a handful of fledgling companies such as Fairlight, E-mu, and Ensoniq.  Like Yamaha and Casio, however, Korg did not stay long in the sampling arena.  The DSS-1 (along with the rackmount DSM-1) was the company's only sampler until 1998 when Korg introduced sampling options on their Triton and Trinity series of workstations, and on their Electribe series of drum-and-phrase samplers. The Teenage Engineering OP-1 is a synthesizer, sampler and sequencer designed and manufactured by the Stockholm-based company Teenage Engineering.  The OP-1 is Teenage Engineering's first product; it was released in 2011 following an introduction at the NAMM Show.  It is also considered their core product. Synton was a manufacturer and distributor of high-end electronic music equipment in the Netherlands.  They were one of the principal importers of music equipment from E-Mu, Ensoniq, and Fairlight in Europe.  Felix Visser, the founder of Synton began the company in 1973 after purchasing an EMS Synthi AKS and setting out to produce similar equipment with more of the functionality that he was looking for in an analog synth.  Eventually, the company developed Synton Syntovox vocoders as well as the System 2000 and System 3000 modular synthesizers that were sold to Karlheinz Stockhausen and distributed in the United States by Bob Moog's Big Briar Inc.  In 1983, Felix Visser, product specialist Marc Paping, and designer Bert Vermeulen created the Synton Syrinx, a monophonic analog synthesizer that contained unique features such as a metal touchplate for manipulating sound as well as a formant filter.  In 1989, the company went bankrupt. The Studio 440 was a sampler sequencer and workstation manufactured by Dave Smith's Sequential Circuits (SCI) and released in 1986.  The sampler's core is similar to that of the Prophet 2000 and Prophet 2002 [3], however, instead of a keyboard, the Studio 440 used a drum machine format and included a sequencer.  The 440 also made it easier to access the full 512kb of memory available, to create samples as long as 12 seconds.  Like the Prophet 3000, the Studio 440—and many of Sequential's products—lost sales due to the brand loyalty demanded by its competitors, including Akai Professional, Roland Corporation, and Korg. The EPS (Ensoniq Performance Sampler) was one of the first few affordable samplers on the market.  It was manufactured from 1988 to 1991 by Ensoniq in Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA.  The EPS was a 13 bit sampler. An electronic drum, also known as digital drums or digital percussion, is a modern electronic musical instrument, a special type of synthesizer or sampler, primarily designed to serve as an alternative to an acoustic drum kit or other percussion instruments.  An electronic drum consists of an electronic or digital sound module which produces the synthesized or sampled percussion sounds and one or more electric sensors to trigger the sounds.  Like regular drums, the sensors are struck by drum sticks or by the hands (depending on the type of drum pad) and they are played in a similar manner as an acoustic drum kit. A sampler is an electronic or digital musical instrument similar in some respects to a synthesizer, but instead of generating new sounds with filters and oscillators, it uses sound recordings (or \"samples\") of real instrument sounds (e.g., a piano, violin or trumpet), excerpts from recorded songs (e.g., a five second bass guitar riff from a funk song) or other sounds (e.g., car horns, sirens, ocean waves).  The samples are loaded or recorded by the user or by a manufacturer.  These sounds are then played back by means of the sampler program itself, a MIDI keyboard, sequencer or another triggering device (e.g., electronic drums) to perform or compose music.  Because these samples are usually stored in digital memory, the information can be quickly accessed.  A single sample may often be pitch-shifted to different pitches to produce musical scales and chords.", "com_question": "What year was the Ensoniq Fizmo developed?

There have been nine business routes for Interstate 75 in the US state of Michigan.  Numbered either Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) or Business Spur Interstate 75 (BS I-75) depending if they are a full business loop or a business spur, these highways are former routings of I-75's predecessor highways in the state.  They were designated as I-75 was completed through the various areas of Michigan.  The business loop in Pontiac runs through that city's downtown along a section of Woodward Avenue and a segment of roadway formerly used by M-24.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_238", "context": "Il Pompeo is a dramma per musica in three acts by composer Alessandro Scarlatti.  Written in 1682 when Scarlatti was 22 years old, it was his fourth opera and first dramatic work on a serious and grand subject.  The opera uses an Italian language libretto by Nicolò Minato which had previously been used by Francesco Cavalli for his 1666 opera \"Pompeo Magno\".  The work premiered at the Teatro di Palazzo Colonna in Rome on 25 January 1683. Francesco Cavalli (14 February 1602 – 14 January 1676) was an Italian composer of the early Baroque period.  His real name was Pietro Francesco Caletti-Bruni, but he is better known by that of Cavalli, the name of his patron Federico Cavalli, a Venetian nobleman. One Came Home is a children's historical novel set in Wisconsin during 1871, written by Amy Timberlake and published by Knopf in 2013.  \"One Came Home\" is a winner of the Edgar Award for Best Juvenile Mystery and a Newbery Honor award in 2014.  This book was published by Random House Children’s Books on January 7, 2014.  Along with the Edgar Award and a Newbery Honor, \"One Came Home\", was named best book of the year by the Washington Post, Kirkus Reviews, Bookpage, Bank Street, and National Public Radio.  It was also a part of the Scholastic Book Club selection. Orfeo (\"Orpheus\") is an opera in three acts by the Italian composer Antonio Sartorio.  The libretto, by Aurelio Aureli, is based on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.  It was first performed at the Teatro San Salvatore, Venice in 1672.  With its clear division between arias (of which there are about 50) and recitative, the work marks a transition in style between the Venetian opera of Francesco Cavalli and the new form of opera seria.  Modern reactions to the work have been mixed, with Tim Carter describing it as \"a fairly dismal example of a genre with all the symptoms of terminal decline...[Orfeo]'s journey to Hades seems almost a Sunday-school outing...Whether satire or not, this is indeed a sorry tale.\" Wilhelm Richard Wagner ( ; ] ; 22 May 181313 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist, and conductor who is primarily known for his operas (or, as some of his later works were later known, \"music dramas\").  Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works.  Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" (\"total work of art\"), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama.  He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852.  Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"). Giulio Strozzi (1583 - 31 March 1652) was a Venetian poet and libretto writer.  His libretti were put to music by composers like Claudio Monteverdi, Francesco Cavalli, Francesco Manelli, and Francesco Sacrati.  He sometimes used the pseudonym Luigi Zorzisto. Le nozze di Teti e di Peleo is an opera by Francesco Cavalli - specifically, an \"opera scenica\" or \"festa teatrale\".  The work, set to a libretto by Orazio Persiani, was Cavalli's first opera, and was first performed at the Venetian opera house Teatro San Cassiano on 24 January 1639.  It is also the first Venetian opera for which a score survives to this day. Giovanni Faustini (1615 – 19 December 1651) was an Italian librettist and opera impresario of the 17th century.  He is best remembered for his collaborations with the composer Francesco Cavalli. Gli amori d'Apollo e di Dafne (\"The Loves of Apollo and Daphne\") is an opera by the Italian composer Francesco Cavalli.  It was Cavalli's second operatic work and was premiered at the Teatro San Cassiano, Venice during the Carnival season of 1640.  The libretto is by Giovanni Francesco Busenello and is based on the story of the god Apollo's love for the nymph Daphne as told in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". Hugues-Adhémar Cuénod (] ; 26 June 19026 December 2010) was a Swiss tenor known for his performances in international opera, operetta, both traditional and musical theatre, and on the concert stage, where he was particularly known for his clear, light, romantic and expressive poised interpretation of \"mélodie\" (French art song).  His repertoire encompassed everything from the medieval chansons of Guillaume de Machaut to the avant garde works of Igor Stravinsky, as well as recordings of lute songs.  Cuénod contributed to the revival of baroque music, performing compositions by Francesco Cavalli and others.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_242", "context": "Glencoe Ski area (also known as Glencoe Mountain or the White Corries ski centre), near Glencoe, Highland, is the oldest ski area in Britain and hosted the country's first ski tow which was installed in 1955 for around £5,000.  The ski area has eight lifts on Meall a' Bhuiridh, which serve a variety of ski runs.  However, with recent funding, a new non-detachable poma has been added to the mountain for the start of the 2016 season, and the installation of another chairlift has been proposed which will be operational for the 2017/18 season.  The current access chairlift will also be renovated, with new chairs and engine drive, and so will the cafe facilities at the base of the mountain, with a new ticketing system as well as an improved ski hire shop.  The resort is currently home to Scotlands longest and steepest skiing slopes. In Irish mythology, Nechtan was the father and/or husband of Boann, eponymous goddess of the River Boyne.  Elsewhere her husband is named as Elcmar.  He may be Nuada under another name, or his cult may have been replaced by that of Nuada; others maintain that Nechtan may be another name for the Dagda.  His inhabited the otherworldly Síd Nechtain, the mythological form of Carbury Hill.  In the Dindsenchas Nechtan is described as the husband of Boann and the son of Nuadu. Sua Ghin Gnua is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Thailand, formerly known as Siam.  Another name for the game is Tigers and Oxen.  It is a hunt game played on a 5x5 square grid with only orthogonal lines.  One player plays the three tigers, and the other player plays the twelve oxen.  The board is empty in the beginning.  Players first drop their pieces onto the board, and then are able to move them.  The tigers can capture the oxen by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, but the oxen attempt to elude and at the same time hem in the tiger.  Sua Ghin Gnua most resembles the tiger hunt games (or tiger games) such as Bagh-Chal, Rimau-rimau, Main Tapal Empat, Catch the Hare, and Adugo since they all use a 5 x 5 square grid.  But tiger games technically consist of a standard Alquerque board which is a 5 x 5 square grid with several diagonal lines criss-crossing through it which are completely missing in Sua Ghin Gnua.  There are however some variants of Catch the Hare which have missing diagonal lines also.  Another game that resembles Sua Ghin Gnua is from Myanmar called Tiger and Buffaloes which is a hunt game consisting of a 4 x 4 square grid with no diagonal lines.  Myanmar happens to border Thailand geographically so there might be a historical connection between the two games.  Another game from Myanmar is Lay Gwet Kyah that is presumed to be similar to Sua Ghin Gnua.  Sua Ghin Gnua was briefly described by Stewart Culin, in his book \"Chess and Playing Cards: Catalogue of Games and Implements for Divination Exhibited by the United States National Museum in Connection with the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania at the Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia 1895\" (1898).  It's also briefly mentioned by H.J.R. Murray in his book \"A History of Chess\" (1913).  It was also described by R.C. Bell, in his book \"Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations\" (1969). Sonora Santanera is an orchestra playing tropical music from Mexico with over 60 years of history.  The band was founded in 1955 by Carlos Colorado in the state of Tabasco, modeled after an earlier Cuban band called Sonora Matancera.  However, the band created its own style.  In 1960, comic actor Jesús “Palillo” Martínez helped the band play in Mexico City and get a professional record deal under the name of Sonora Santanera.  From that time until 1986, the band changed members, but remained focused on Carlos Colorado, the sole musical arranger for the group.  Colorado died in a bus accident in 1986, causing some members to split off and form another orchestra called Los Santaneros.  The remaining members changed name to Internacional Sonora Santanera.  Since the 1980s, little of the band’s sound changed although members continued to do so.  In the 2000s, more bands appeared using the name of Sonora Santanera as part of their names, leading the orchestra to pursue legal actions and another name change in 2007 to the current name of \"La Única Internacional Sonora Santanera\".

The story is about how he faces his obstacles with his logic. The Hanwell Band was a brass band formed in Hanwell in 1891.

Descended from the old German breed, the Stoeberer (lit.  \"rummager\"), which became popular with commoners following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, who required a versatile hunting dog.  Stoeberer is now a type of hunting dog in Germany with the Wachtelhund being its sole member.  The breed is not very well known outside of Germany, but was recognised by the United Kennel Club in 1996. The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game.  It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years.  They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines.  The breed suffers from average health complaints.  The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to \"rage syndrome\", although the disorder is very rare.  It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter.  The smaller \"cockers\" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or \"spring,\" game.  In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed.  They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis.  The term \"Springer\" comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air. The Terceira Mastiff (Portuguese: ] ) is a landrace Portuguese dog breed, also known as the Rabo Torto (\"rabo\"=tail, \"torto\"=curled/twisted).  Neither the Fédération Cynologique Internationale nor the local Clube Português de Canicultura has officially recognized it.  It is a remarkable ancestor to both the Cão Fila de São Miguel and the Fila Brasileiro .  This breed is fully different from the Barbado da Terceira The Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog.  It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds.  It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain.  However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century.  Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections. The English Cocker Spaniel is a breed of gun dog.  The English Cocker Spaniel is an active, good-natured, sporting dog standing well up at the withers and compactly built.  There are \"field\" or \"working\" cockers and \"show\" cockers.  It is one of several varieties of spaniel and somewhat resembles its American cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel, although it is closer to the working-dog form of the Field Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel. The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct breed of dog which was used in mountain rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the Great St. Bernard Pass.  The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat.  One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods.  Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease.  Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period.  The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel. The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog.  It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK.  In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as \"Cocker Spaniel\" before the American variety was created.  The word \"cocker\" is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while \"spaniel\" is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain. The Toy Trawler Spaniel is an extinct breed of Spaniel which physically was similar to the King Charles Spaniel of the 16th century.  It is considered to have descended from the original King Charles Spaniel, and the older variety of Sussex Spaniel.  It was originally used as a sporting dog, but became used as a toy and show dog.  It was considered to be on the verge of extinction by 1920.  A preserved specimen is kept in Tring at the Natural History Museum. The Fila Brasileiro (] ) also known as the Brazilian Mastiff is a large working breed of dog developed in Brazil.  It is known for its superb tracking ability, aggressiveness and an unforgiving impetuous temperament.  When a Brazilian Mastiff finds its quarry, it does not attack it, but rather holds it at bay until the hunter arrives.  Owing to these qualities, the Brazilian Mastiff is used as a guard dog, as a shepherd dog for herding livestock and as a hunting dog for tracking and controlling large prey.  When slavery was legal in Brazil, the Brazilian Mastiff was used to return fugitives unharmed to their slave masters.  This breed has been banned in many countries because of its temperament and potential for aggression. The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family.  Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel.  They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity.  Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel.  The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern.  Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers.  Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions.  They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.", "com_question": "Which breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1996?

The FW16 competed in the 1994 Formula One season and was used by British driver Damon Hill to finish runner-up in the 1994 World Drivers' Championship.  It was also the car in which 3 time world champion Ayrton Senna was killed during the third race of the 1994 season, the San Marino Grand Prix.  Its engine was a Renault RS6 3.5 V10.  The team's main sponsor was Rothmans, replacing Camel Cigarettes and Canon used on the FW14 and FW15C.  The car was designed around the major regulation changes that the FIA had introduced in the off-season, banning the various electronic devices that had been used by the front running cars during the preceding two seasons. The 2006 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the XXVI Gran Premio Foster's di San Marino) was a Formula One motor race held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy on 23 April 2006.  The 62-lap race was the fourth round of the 2006 Formula One season, and the 26th running of the San Marino Grand Prix.  It was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher, who had started from pole position.  It was both his and Ferrari's first win of the season, thus effectively starting their respective championship bids.  Championship leader Fernando Alonso finished second for the Renault team, whilst Juan Pablo Montoya completed the podium with third position for McLaren. The 1994 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 15 May 1994 at the Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo.  It was the fourth race of the 1994 Formula One season, and the first following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks previously. The 1993–94 Serie A was won by Milan, being the 14th title for the \"rossoneri\" and their third in succession, complemented by glory in the UEFA Champions League.  It was a disappointing season in the league for Inter Milan, whose 13th-place finish saw them avoid relegation by a single point, but they compensated for this by winning the UEFA Cup.  Piacenza, Udinese, Atlanta and Lecce were all relegated.  A.C. Milan's visit to struggling Reggiana at San Siro on 1 May 1994 came on a day when the sporting world was overshadowed with the death of racing driver Ayrton Senna in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, but the football world was focused on AC Milan's attempts to seal a 14th scudetto title.  It was a narrow 0–1 defeat for Reggiana, with a goal from Massimiliano Esposito, but enough to seal the \"Scudetto\". Roland Ratzenberger (] ; 4 July 1960 – 30 April 1994) was an Austrian racing driver who raced in sports prototype, British Formula 3000, Japanese Formula 3000 and Formula One.  He died during qualifying for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, the same event at which three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna died the following day. Three-time Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna died on 1 May 1994, as a result of his car crashing into a concrete barrier while he was leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Italy.  The previous day, Roland Ratzenberger had died when his car crashed during qualification for the race.  His and Senna's accidents were the worst of several accidents that took place that weekend and were the first fatal accidents to occur during a Formula One race meeting in twelve years.  They became a turning point in the safety of Formula One, prompting the implementation of new safety measures in both Formula One and the circuit, as well as the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to be re-established.  The Italian Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that mechanical failure was the cause of the accident, although this has been disputed. The 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 48th season of FIA Formula One motor racing.  It featured the 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship which commenced on 27 March 1994, and ended on 13 November after sixteen races.  The season is remembered as one of the most tragic and controversial seasons in the sport's history.  1994 was one of the closest championships in history as Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' title by a single point from Damon Hill after the two controversially collided at the final round in Adelaide.  Schumacher had built up a huge championship lead, winning six of the first seven races, before two disqualifications and a race ban allowed Hill to close the gap.  British constructor Williams-Renault won the Constructors' Championship.  However, the 1994 season will also be remembered for the deaths of three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix.  Forty-six drivers competed in the 1994 World Championship, including fourteen who made their F1 debut and numerous pay drivers. Mercedes-Benz also returned to the sport for the first time since 1955 as an engine supplier to Swiss team, Sauber.  The season also saw the first win for Ferrari since 1990 – whilst McLaren failed to win a single race following the departure of Senna, before embarking on a long-term partnership with Mercedes. Associazione Calcio Milan won three trophies during a successful 1993–94 season, most memorable for the 4–0 victory against FC Barcelona in the Champions League Final in Athens.  That game saw a goal explosion from a Milan side that had been extremely defensive during the entire league season, which in part caused the Italian Football Federation to introduce three points for victories starting in the autumn 1994.  Milan won Serie A with a mere 36 goals scored in 34 games, but conceding a mere 15, which meant they had the defensive line, with Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini as key players, to thank for their third consecutive domestic success.  Milan's match against struggling Reggiana at San Siro on 1 May 1994 came on a day when the sporting world was overshadowed with the death of racing driver Ayrton Senna in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, but the football world was focused on AC Milan's attempts to seal a 14th title.  It was a narrow 1–0 defeat for Reggiana, with a goal from Massimiliano Esposito, but enough to seal the Scudetto. Ayrton Senna da Silva (] ; 21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver who won three Formula One world championships for McLaren in 1988, 1990 and 1991, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time.  He died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix for Williams. The 2005 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the XXV Gran Premio Foster's di San Marino) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 April 2005 at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_248", "context": "Stenka Razin, Op. 13, is a symphonic poem composed by Alexander Glazunov in 1885.  Dedicated to the memory of Alexander Borodin, it is one of the few compositions written by Glazunov on a nationalist subject and is composed in a style reminiscent of Borodin and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Alexander Borodin's Scherzo in A-flat major is a lively piece written in 1885, while Borodin was in Belgium for an early performance of his then incomplete opera \"Prince Igor\".  It was originally written for solo piano but in 1889 Alexander Glazunov orchestrated it, along with the \"Petite Suite\".  Borodin dedicated the piece to Théodore Jadoul, who made a four-hand piano arrangement of it. In the Steppes of Central Asia (Russian: В средней Азии, \"V srednyeĭ Azii\", literally \"In Central Asia\") is the common English title for a \"musical tableau\" (or symphonic poem) by Alexander Borodin, composed in 1880. The Petite Suite is a suite of seven piano pieces, written by Alexander Borodin, and acknowledged as his major work for the piano.  It was published in 1885, although some of the pieces had been written as far back as the late 1870s.  After Borodin's death, Alexander Glazunov orchestrated the work, and added his orchestration of another of Borodin's pieces as an eighth number. The Hunsdiecker reaction (also called the Borodin reaction after Alexander Borodin) is the organic reaction of silver salts of carboxylic acids with halogens to give organic halides.  It is an example of a halogenation reaction.  The reaction is named after Heinz Hunsdiecker and Cläre Hunsdiecker, but was first noted by Borodin in 1861 when he prepared methyl bromide from silver acetate. Gluck Peak ( ) is a rock peak, 335 m high, located 6.5 nmi south-southwest of Mount Borodin and immediately north of Alyabiev Glacier, lying between the bases of Bennett Dome and Shostakovich Peninsula on south side of the Beethoven Peninsula, southwest Alexander Island, Antarctica.  It was first mapped from air photos taken by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition, 1947–48, by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960, and was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Christoph Willibald von Gluck, the Austrian composer (1714-1787). Symphony No. 2 in B minor by Alexander Borodin was composed intermittently between 1869 and 1876.  It consists of four movements and is considered the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself.  It has many melodic resemblances to both \"Prince Igor\" and \"Mlada\", two theatre works that diverted Borodin's attention on and off during the six years of composition. The String Quartet No. 2 is a string quartet in D major written by Alexander Borodin in 1881.  It was dedicated to his wife Ekaterina Protopova.  Some scholars, such as Borodin’s biographer Serge Dianin, suggest that the quartet was a 20th anniversary gift and that it has a program evoking the couple’s first meeting in Heidelberg.  Of its four movements, the third movement “Notturno” is the most famous, and part of it was adapted into the song “And This Is My Beloved” from the 1953 Broadway musical \"Kismet\". \"Fate\" is a popular song from the 1953 musical \"Kismet\" and is credited to Robert Wright and George Forrest.  Like all the music in that show, the melody was in fact based on music composed by Alexander Borodin, in this case, Borodin's \"Symphony No.2.\"  It was introduced on Broadway by Alfred Drake.  Howard Keel performed the song in the film version. Mount Borodin ( ) is a mainly ice-covered mountain, 695 m high, with a rock outcrop on the east side, 7 nmi north-northeast of Gluck Peak in the southwest part of Alexander Island, Antarctica.  A number of peaks in this general vicinity first appear on the maps of the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), 1947–48.

The Mendocino Ridge AVA is a coastal, cool climate and high altitude American Viticultural Area located entirely within the coastal zone of Mendocino County, California.  The boundaries of the AVA encompass the coastal ridges adjacent to the Pacific Ocean that reach inland toward the Anderson Valley.  Roughly 36 miles of the southernmost portion of the Mendocino Coast make up the western boundary of the AVA, with the Sonoma County line as the southern boundary, the Navarro River as the northern boundary and Anderson Valley as the inland boundary running northwest-southeast.  The Mendocino Ridge AVA “is essentially a northern extension of the true Sonoma Coast viticultural area.”  However, the Mendocino Ridge AVA designation is unique in that it is limited by elevation, reserved only for vineyards at or above 1200 feet.  This is why the Mendocino Ridge AVA has been nicknamed “Islands in the Sky®,” because the vineyards sitting at 1200 feet or higher are often perched above thick fog moving inland from the Pacific Ocean blanketing the coast and the valleys between the ridge tops, making the tips of the mountains look like islands protruding from a sea of fog.  In this overlapping, “[t]he Mendocino Ridge AVA floats above the Anderson Valley and Mendocino appellations.”  Mendocino Ridge is the only non-contiguous AVA in the United States; all others are contiguous landmasses with all vineyards inside the boundaries designated as part of the AVA, whereas Mendocino Ridge in comparison only includes the higher altitude growing sites.  “There are 262,400 acres (410 square miles, 36 miles long from north to south) within the outer boundaries of the Mendocino Ridge viticultural area, but the actual viticultural area encompasses only 87,466 acres which lie above 1,200 feet elevation.  Of these 87,466 acres, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 acres (2% of the total acreage) of the ridge tops are suitable for vineyards.  The side-slopes are very steep (often above 70%) and covered with timber, making them unfit for planting”.  Estimates of planted acres range from 233 to 410, which accounts for about 0.3% of the total area.  These planted acres are scattered among 16 remote vineyards.

It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will.  Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories.  The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award.  The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal. The Nobel Prize in Physics (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i fysik\" ) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. This is a list of Danish Nobel laureates.  Since the Nobel Prize was established per the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel in 1895, 12 of the prize winners have been from Denmark.  The first Danish Nobel laureate was Niels Ryberg Finsen, who won a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1903 for his work in using light therapy to treat diseases.  The most recent Danish Nobel Prize winner was Jens Skou who won the prize in chemistry for his discovery over the enzyme, Na+/K+-ATPase in 1997.  To date, of the 13 Nobel Prizes won by Danish people, 5 have been for medicine, 3 have been for physics, 3 have been for literature, 1 has been for chemistry and one has been for peace. Aage Niels Bohr (] ; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\".  Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments.  Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Susumu Tonegawa (利根川 進 \"Tonegawa Susumu\", born September 6, 1939) is a Japanese scientist who was the sole recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1987, for his discovery of the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity.

He was the first Pakistani and first Muslim to receive a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize (after Anwar Sadat of Egypt). The Nobel Prizes are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Physics, Literature, Peace, Physiology or Medicine and Economics.  All but the economics prize were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation.  The Nobel prize in Economics, or The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for outstanding contributions in the field of Economics.  Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. Evan James Williams FRS (8 June 1903 – 29 September 1945) was a Welsh experimental physicist who worked in a number of fields with some of the most notable physicists of his day, including Patrick Blackett, Lawrence Bragg, Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i litteratur\" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: \"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin\" ) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists and doctors in the various fields of physiology or medicine.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.  As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute.  While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for \"physiology or medicine\" in his will.  Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields.  The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.  In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008.

It is employed as a literary device by authors to express shock, surprise or annoyance.  The phrase is based on real nautical slang and is a reference to the timbers, which are the wooden support frames of a sailing ship.  In heavy seas, ships would be lifted up and pounded down so hard as to \"shiver\" the timbers, startling the sailors.  Such an exclamation was meant to convey a feeling of fear and awe, similar to, \"Well, blow me down!\" , or, \"May God strike me alive and well\".  Shiver is also reminiscent of the splintering of a ship's timbers in battle – splinter wounds were a common form of battle injury on wooden ships ('shiver' means splinter in some English dialects).

Former President Andrew Jackson backed James K. Polk for the position of vice president, but Van Buren supported his vice president's renomination.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_260", "context": "Pál Kadosa (] ; 6 September 1903, Léva, Austria-Hungary (now Levice, Slovakia) – 30 March 1983, Budapest) was a pianist and Hungarian composer of the post-Bartók generation.  His early style was influenced by Hungarian folklore while his later works were more toward Hindemith and expressively forceful idioms.  He was born in Levice.  He studied at the national Hungarian Royal Academy of Music under Zoltán Székely and Zoltán Kodály.  He was head of the piano department of the Franz Liszt Academy for many years and his students have included such leading musicians as György Ligeti, György Kurtág, Iván Erőd, Ferenc Rados, Árpád Joó, András Schiff, Zoltán Kocsis, Dezső Ránki, Valéria Szervánszky, Ronald Cavaye, Jenő Jandó, Kenji Watanabe, István Kassai, Balázs Szokolay, etc. Atmosphères is a piece for full orchestra, composed by György Ligeti in 1961.  It is noted for eschewing conventional melody and metre in favor of dense sound textures.  After \"Apparitions\", it was the second piece Ligeti wrote to exploit what he called a \"micropolyphonic\" texture.  It gained further exposure after being used in Stanley Kubrick's film \"\". The Hungarian composer György Ligeti published three string quartets throughout his life - 2 string quartets proper (1953-54, 1968), and a student piece from 1950 published towards the end of Ligeti's life.  The first two string quartets proper represent both his early period, inspired by Béla Bartók, and middle period, which was largely micropolyphonic.  In 2012, sketches and notes for his projected String Quartets Nos. 3 & 4 were discovered by Bianca Ţiplea Temeș at the Paul Sacher Stiftung, and they would represent Ligeti's late period. Le Grand Macabre (1974–77, revised version 1996) is György Ligeti's only opera.  The opera has two acts, and its libretto – based on the 1934 play, \"La balade du grand macabre\", by Michel De Ghelderode – was written by Ligeti in collaboration with , director of the Stockholm puppet theatre.  The original libretto was written in German, as \"Der grosse Makaber\", but for the first production was translated into Swedish by Meschke under its current title .  The opera has been performed also in English, French, Italian, Hungarian and Danish.  Only a few notes need be changed to perform the opera in any of these languages. The Hungarian composer György Ligeti composed a cycle of 18 études for solo piano between 1985 and 2001.  They are considered one of the major creative achievements of his last decades, and one of the most significant sets of piano studies of the 20th century, combining virtuoso technical problems with expressive content, following in the line of the études of Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Claude Debussy, and Alexander Scriabin but addressing new technical ideas as a compendium of the concepts Ligeti had worked out in his other works since the 1950s.  Pianist Jeremy Denk wrote that they \"are a crowning achievement of his career and of the piano literature; though still new, they are already classics.\" Musica ricercata is a set of eleven pieces for piano by György Ligeti.  The work was composed from 1951 to 1953, shortly after the composer began lecturing at the Budapest Academy of Music.  The work premiered on 18 November 1969 in Sundsvall, Sweden.  Although the ricercata (or ricercar) is an established contrapuntal style (and the final movement of the work is in that form), Ligeti's title should probably be interpreted literally as \"researched music\" or \"sought music\".  This work captures the essence of Ligeti's search to construct his own compositional style \"ex nihilo\", and as such presages many of the more radical directions Ligeti would take in the future. The Festival Dancing in Your Head is a festival dedicated to commissioning, producing, and presenting new music and music films from around the world.  The festival is produced by Headwaters Music, a non-profit music organization, led by composer Anthony Gatto.  The 2005 festival at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis celebrated the 75th birthday of Ornette Coleman with nearly 100 international musicians, including an evening with The Ornette Coleman Quartet.  Past festival performers include the Kronos Quartet, Bang on a Can All-stars, So Percussion, Alarm Will Sound, Iva Bittová, Ethel, Flux Quartet, The Bad Plus, Happy Apple, Low, Gao Hong, Dean Granros and Antigravity, Tibetan Monks of the Gyuto Wheel of Dharma Monastery, Dosh, Patrick Crossland, Douglas Ewart, Anthony Cox.  Composers performed include Steve Reich, David Lang, Michael Gordon, John Adams, Arvo Pärt, György Ligeti, Martin Bresnick, Brian Ferneyhough, Annie Gosfield, John King, Phil Kline, Evan Ziporyn, Béla Bartók. György Ligeti composed his Viola Sonata between 1991 and 1994.  It is a sonata for viola solo in six movements, and Ligeti composed it in various phases, parallel with his Violin Concerto, and his piano études.  The composer was inspired to write a viola sonata after hearing Tabea Zimmermann playing on the radio, then began writing various movements.  The second movement \"Loop\", was premiered by Garth Knox (then violist of the Arditti Quartet), while \"Facsar\" was premiered in 1993 by Jürg Dahler.  The two movements were conceived as part of a complete work and that became the second and third movements of Ligeti's Viola Sonata. Artikulation is an electronic composition by György Ligeti.  Composed and notated in January and February 1958, the piece was prepared and recorded on magnetic tape from February to March with the assistance of Gottfried Michael Koenig and Karlheinz Stockhausen's assistant, Cornelius Cardew, at the Studio for Electronic Music of the West German Radio (WDR) in Cologne.  The piece consists of various types of sounds, \"in conditions of aggregation.\"  It \"can be heard as a conversation without words.\"  Ligeti explains in notes to the listening score (see below): György Ligeti (] ; born 19 December 1972) is a Hungarian indie musician, record producer, best known as the lead singer, songwriter, lyricist and guitarist of the indie rock band We Are Rockstars, and the disbanded The Puzzle.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_261", "context": "In Riemannian geometry, the Cheeger isoperimetric constant of a compact Riemannian manifold \"M\" is a positive real number \"h\"(\"M\") defined in terms of the minimal area of a hypersurface that divides \"M\" into two disjoint pieces.  In 1970, Jeff Cheeger proved an inequality that related the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on \"M\" to \"h\"(\"M\").  This proved to be a very influential idea in Riemannian geometry and global analysis and inspired an analogous theory for graphs. Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman (Russian: Григо́рий Я́ковлевич Перельма́н ; ] ; born 13 June 1966) is a Russian mathematician.  He made a contribution to Riemannian geometry and geometric topology. In differential geometry, a (smooth) Riemannian manifold or (smooth) Riemannian space (\"M\",\"g\") is a real smooth manifold \"M\" equipped with an inner product formula_1 on the tangent space formula_2 at each point formula_3 that varies smoothly from point to point in the sense that if \"X\" and \"Y\" are vector fields on \"M\", then formula_4 is a smooth function.  The family formula_1 of inner products is called a Riemannian metric (tensor).  These terms are named after the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann.  The study of Riemannian manifolds constitutes the subject called Riemannian geometry. In geometric topology, Busemann functions are used to study the large-scale geometry of geodesics in Hadamard spaces and in particular Hadamard manifolds (simply connected complete Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive curvature).  They are named after Herbert Busemann, who introduced them; he gave an extensive treatment of the topic in his 1955 book \"The geometry of geodesics\". In mathematics, specifically Riemannian geometry, Synge's theorem is a classical result relating the curvature of a Riemannian manifold to its topology.  It is named for John Lighton Synge, who proved it in 1936.  Let \"M\" be a compact Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature.  The theorem asserts: In Riemannian geometry, the scalar curvature (or the Ricci scalar) is the simplest curvature invariant of a Riemannian manifold.  To each point on a Riemannian manifold, it assigns a single real number determined by the intrinsic geometry of the manifold near that point.  Specifically, the scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space.  In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the Gaussian curvature, and completely characterizes the curvature of a surface.  In more than two dimensions, however, the curvature of Riemannian manifolds involves more than one functionally independent quantity. Ruppeiner geometry is thermodynamic geometry (a type of information geometry) using the language of Riemannian geometry to study thermodynamics.  George Ruppeiner proposed it in 1979.  He claimed that thermodynamic systems can be represented by Riemannian geometry, and that statistical properties can be derived from the model. In mathematics, the soul theorem is a theorem of Riemannian geometry that largely reduces the study of complete manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature to that of the compact case.  Cheeger and Gromoll proved the theorem in 1972 by generalizing a 1969 result of Gromoll and Wolfgang Meyer.  The related soul conjecture was formulated by Gromoll and Cheeger in 1972 and proved by Grigori Perelman in 1994 with an astonishingly concise proof. In mathematics, the Riemannian connection on a surface or Riemannian 2-manifold refers to several intrinsic geometric structures discovered by Tullio Levi-Civita, Élie Cartan and Hermann Weyl in the early part of the twentieth century: parallel transport, covariant derivative and connection form .  These concepts were put in their current form with principal bundles only in the 1950s.  The classical nineteenth century approach to the differential geometry of surfaces, due in large part to Carl Friedrich Gauss, has been reworked in this modern framework, which provides the natural setting for the classical theory of the moving frame as well as the Riemannian geometry of higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.  This account is intended as an introduction to the theory of connections. In Riemannian geometry, the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that on any Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold) there is a unique torsion-free metric connection, called the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric.  Here a metric (or Riemannian) connection is a connection which preserves the metric tensor.  More precisely:", "com_question": "What is Grigori Perelman's birthdate?

Audrey Hepburn (4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a British actress who had an extensive career in film, television, and on the stage from 1948 to 1993.  Considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women of all time, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute.  Hepburn is also remembered as both a film and style icon.  Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film \"Dutch in Seven Lessons\".  Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals \"High Button Shoes\" (1948), and \"Sauce Tartare\" (1949).  Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play \"Gigi\".  Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star.  For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.  In 1954 she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy \"Sabrina\" opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden.

James \"Jimmy the Hat\" Lanza (October 23, 1902 – February 14, 2006) was an Sicilian-American mobster and boss of the San Francisco crime family.  He was the son of the first known boss of the San Francisco crime family and took over in 1961.  It is now probably extinct.  He was first noticed when \"Life\" magazine published his photo in the late 1960s, identifying him as boss of the San Francisco crime family. Steven Mazzone (born 1964) is an American mobster believed to be a high ranking member of the Philadelphia crime family.  Mazzone's rise in power through the Philadelphia underworld began as a protege of former boss turned informant, Ralph Natale.  After the family was decimated by prosecutions during the Nicodemo Scarfo and John Stanfa eras, Natale was released from prison in 1994 and shortly thereafter became the new boss of the crime family.  Natale partnered with the \"Young Turks\" faction that was one of the few remnants left of the Philadelphia crime family, and their leader, Joseph \"Skinny Joey\" Merlino.  After Natale assumed the top position as boss, he positioned Merlino as underboss and Ronald Turchi as the consigliere in the new hierarchy.  This administration is still in question to this day, as many now believe that Merlino was running the family behind the scenes, letting Natale have the boss position to deter law enforcement from himself. William \"Wild Guy\" Grasso was an Italian-American gangster from East Haven, Connecticut who served as underboss to Raymond Patriarca, Jr. (a.k.a. \"Junior\") in the Patriarca crime family, also known as the New England crime family, the Providence crime family or the Boston crime family.  The Patriarca family is a Mafia crime family based in New England.  Succeeding his father Raymond L.S. Patriarca as boss after his father's death in 1984, Junior was considered a weak leader.  He managed to keep the peace in his crime family due to the support of the Gambino crime family of New York.  When Junior's original underboss Ilario \"Larry Baione\" Maria Antonio Zannino was sentenced to thirty years in prison in 1987, it further weakened Junior's position.  With Zannino in jail, Grasso became underboss. Consigliere (Italian \"consigliere\" \"counselor\", pronounced ] , roughly ; plural \"consiglieri\") is a position within the leadership structure of the Sicilian, Calabrian and American Mafia.  The word was popularized by the novel \"The Godfather\" (1969) and its film adaptation.  In the novel, a consigliere is an advisor or counselor to the boss, with the additional responsibility of representing the boss in important meetings both within the boss's crime family and with other crime families.  The consigliere is a close, trusted friend and confidant, the mob's version of an elder statesman; he is an adviser to the boss in a Mafia crime family, and sometimes is his 'right-hand man'.  In some depictions, he is devoid of ambition and dispenses disinterested advice.  This passive image of the consigliere does not correspond with what little is known of real-life consiglieri, however.  By the very nature of the job, a consigliere is one of the few in the family who can argue with the boss, and is often tasked with challenging the boss when needed, to ensure subsequent plans are foolproof. The Milwaukee crime family or Balistrieri crime family is an American Mafia crime family based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The crime family was considered a branch of the Chicago Outfit.  The family's most influential boss was Frank \"Mr. Big\" Balistrieri, who was greatly involved in the Las Vegas skimming casinos. Today, the crime family is nearly extinct, since Balistrieri died in 1993, with the \"Chicago Outfit\" gaining control over some of the illegal rackets in the area. Vincent Louis Gigante ( ; March 29, 1928 – December 19, 2005), also known as \"Chin\", was a New York Italian-American mobster in the American Mafia who was boss of the Genovese crime family from 1981 to 2005.  Gigante started out as a professional boxer who fought 25 bouts between 1944 and 1947.  He then started working as a Mafia enforcer for what was then the Luciano crime family.  Gigante was one of five brothers: Mario, Pasquale, Ralph and he all became mobsters in the Luciano family, forerunner of the Genovese family.  Only one brother, Louis, stayed out of the crime family, instead becoming a priest.  Gigante was the shooter in the failed assassination of longtime Luciano boss Frank Costello in 1957.  After sharing a prison cell with Costello's rival, Vito Genovese, following Vito's conviction for heroin trafficking, Gigante became a caporegime, overseeing his own crew of Genovese soldiers and associates that operated out of Greenwich Village.  Gigante was one of Genovese's most loyal supporters, siding with him throughout the struggle for power with Costello. Matthew M. \"Mike\" Trupiano, Jr. (November 8, 1938 – October 22, 1997) was the boss of the St. Louis crime family from 1982 to 1997. Joseph Salvatore \"Skinny Joey\" Merlino (born March 16, 1962) is an American mobster believed to be the boss of the Philadelphia crime family despite the appearance of having various legitimate business fronts as well as accounts from acting bosses; led it primarily in loan sharking, gambling and extortion.  During the 1990s, Merlino began a mob war within the crime family and survived numerous assassination attempts.  By 1995 he was the effective leader of the Philadelphia crime family.  Unlike most mobsters who shunned the limelight, Merlino always enjoyed the publicity from the media and the public.  He is the son of deceased Scarfo crime family Underboss Chuckie Merlino. The Patriarca crime family (pronounced ] ) is also known as the New England crime family, the Providence crime family, the Boston crime family, the Boston Mafia, the Providence Mafia, the New England Mafia, or The Office and is an Italian-American Mafia crime family based in New England.

City Park is approximately 50% larger than Central Park in New York City, the municipal park recognized by Americans nationwide as the archetypal urban greenspace.  Although it is an urban park whose land is owned by the City of New Orleans, it is administered by the City Park Improvement Association, an arm of state government, not by the New Orleans Parks and Parkways Department.  City Park is very unusual in that it is a largely self-supporting public park, with most of its annual budget derived from self-generated revenue through user fees and donations.  In the wake of the enormous damage inflicted upon the park due to Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism began to partially subsidize the park's operations. The State Theater was an entertainment venue in Youngstown, Ohio which showed films until the early 1970s and later became a popular night club establishment catering to major rock 'n' roll acts of the 1970s and '80s.  The theater opened in 1927 at 213 Federal Plaza West and exhibited films until closing as a movie house in the early 1970s.  On October 20, 1974, a night club called the Tomorrow Club opened in the old theater.  Under the Tomorrow Club name, the venue hosted such bands as AC/DC, KISS, Rush, Ted Nugent, The Ramones and The Runaways.  Most notably the club played host to The Ramones' first gig outside of the New York City metro area on July 20, 1976.  This was also the gig where Joey Ramone was introduced to future members of the Dead Boys who later moved to New York City to set up shop as the house band at CBGB.  The Tomorrow Club closed on December 22, 1978 and the venue opened as the Youngstown branch of the Agora concert hall chain on December 31, 1978. The Youngstown Agora continued to book popular rock acts until it closed on July 23, 1982.  It reopened under the State Theater and Civic Center name in May 1983, but it closed abruptly again in July 1983.  The theater booked heavy metal and hard rock acts under the Star Theatre name from 1984 until early '86 before being bought by a group interested in turning the theater into a showcase for R&B, blues, jazz, hip-hop and soul groups in late 1986.  The venue struggled under the Starr Palace name and closed for good in late 1988.  The State Theater remained vacant until it was demolished in 2008.  Only the facade remains. Buffalo Niagara International Airport (IATA: BUF, ICAO: KBUF, FAA LID: BUF) is in Cheektowaga, New York, United States, named after the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area.

The Living Room was a music venue on Metropolitan Avenue in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, which was originally established on Stanton Street of the Lower East Side in New York City in New York City in 1988.  The Living Room was co-owned by Steve Rosenthal and Jennifer Gilson.  The Living Room has showcased some of the best of New York City’s singer/songwriter, alt-country, and rock.  It moved to Brooklyn in 2015 before closing down in December of the same year.  This music venue has been called \"an incubator of talent,\" and has been described as \"a much mellower and tidier successor to CBGB.\"  Some considered The Living Room as The Bottom Line of the \"small bankroll\" live rock venues.  Other comparable venues include The Saint in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and The Cellar Door in Georgetown, Washington, D.C..  The Living Room's line up featured four or five singer-songwriters a night, yet the club did not typically charge a cover.  It did have a one drink minimum and a recommended $5 donation for the bands. How To Pick Up Girls is the 1978 made for TV movie filmed on location in New York City starring Desi Arnaz Jr. Bess Armstrong and Fred McCarren. Piper's Opera House is a historic performing arts venue in Virginia City, Storey County, Nevada in the United States.  Piper's served as a training facility in 1897 for heavyweight boxing champion Gentleman Jim Corbett, in preparation for his title bout with Bob Fitzsimmons.  The current structure was built by entrepreneur John Piper in 1885 to replace his 1878 opera house that had burned down.  The 1878 venue, in turn, had been to replace Piper's 1863 venue which was destroyed by the 1875 Great Fire in Virginia City.  Mark Twain spoke from the original Piper's stage in 1866, and again a century later in the third venue, as portrayed by Hal Holbrook in his one-man play \"Mark Twain Tonight!\"  A lynch mob hung a victim from the first venue's rafters in 1871.  American theatrical producer David Belasco was stage manager at the second opera house before moving to New York City.  Piper's opera houses played host to Shakespearean thespians such as Edwin Booth.  Musical performers Lilly Langtry, Al Jolson and John Philip Sousa once performed here.  In 1940, Errol Flynn auctioned off historic Piper memorabilia from the opera house stage, during a live NBC broadcast that coincided with the premiere of Flynn's new movie \"Virginia City\". The Hole-in-the-Wall was a popular saloon and underworld hangout in what is now Financial District, Manhattan, New York City during the early- to mid-19th century.  It has been described as the \"most notorious\" saloon in New York city during the 19th century.  It was one of many dive bars and similar establishments in New York's infamous Fourth Ward, located at the corner of Water and Dover Streets.  The saloon was owned by \"One Armed\" Charley Monell and featured notorious female criminals Kate Flannery and Gallus Mag as bouncers.  Both women were employed by Monell as lieutenants in his local criminal organization, which included shanghaiing, and the latter woman supposedly kept a collection of human ears which she had bitten off from unruly customers in bar brawls.  She displayed these as trophies on the bar in pickle jars.  Sadie the Goat, the later leader of the Charlton Street Gang, was of the many victims who lost her ear in a brawl with Gallus Mag. The Golden Horseshoe Stage (referred to as Pecos Bill's Golden Horseshoe Saloon during construction) opened in 1955 with several other original attractions at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California.  Over the years the venue has housed multiple stage shows; it currently shows Laughing Stock and Company seven days a week.  The \"saloon\" is located in Frontierland and has a picturesque view of the Rivers of America, New Orleans Square and part of Critter Country.

Duhallow GAA is a Gaelic football and Hurling division in the barony of Duhallow, County Cork, Ireland.  This barony is situated in the northwest region of the county, and includes towns such as Kanturk, Millstreet, and Newmarket.  It is one of eight divisions of Cork County Board.  It organizes competitions for the clubs within the division, from Under 12 up to the adult level.  The winners of these competitions compete against other divisional champions to determine which club is the county champion.  In addition, the division selects football and hurling teams from the adult teams playing at junior level or county intermediate level, and these then compete for the Cork Senior Football Championship and Cork Senior Hurling Championship.  Since hurling is the weaker sport in the division, a divisional team has also participated in the Cork Minor Hurling Championship and Cork Under-21 Hurling Championship.

In addition, there were three colleges who are not in Division III who compete primarily against Division 3 schools (and participate in a Division III conference), bringing the total number of teams competing in regular season play to 52 schools (there is one Division 1 team, and two Division 2 teams who play predominantly Division 3 schedules).  Many NCAA Division III schools are smaller than NCAA Division 1 colleges, though size is not the determining factor.  There is a mix of private colleges and public colleges (and universities) among the NCAA Division III schools.  Some women student-athletes play two sports in NCAA Division III, though it remains a challenge to mix hockey and another sport because as a winter sport, hockey will still overlap with a fall or spring sport. The 2016 NAB AFL Under 18 Championships was the 21st edition of the AFL Under 18 Championships.  A new format saw nine teams compete in the championships with four teams competing in division two; Northern Territory, NSW/ACT, Queensland, and Tasmania, and five teams compete in division one; the Allies, South Australia, Vic Metro, Vic Country, and Western Australia, with the Allies team comprising the best players in division two.

Most of the school's sports compete in the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC), with sports not sponsored by the NEWMAC housed in several other conferences.  The football team, which had competed in the New England Football Conference through the 2016 season, will join the bulk of MIT's sports in the NEWMAC in 2017, when that conference begins sponsoring football.  One MIT sport, women's rowing, competes in Division I in the Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC).  Men's water polo, a sport in which the NCAA holds a single national championship for all three of its divisions, competes in the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) alongside Division I and Division II members.  Three sports compete outside of NCAA governance: men's rowing competes in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC), sailing in the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association of ICSA and squash in the College Squash Association.  In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT's eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling. Women's association football is a largely amateur sport in Scotland, given the greater emphasis of the male competitions.  As in the men's game, the women's league structure consists of a Premier League and a Football League with Divisions One and Two, but the second division is split into North, West, East, and South East regions.

The park extends into the Kuningan and Majalengka regencies south of Cirebon.  The park surrounds Mt Ceremai, an active volcano, the highest peak in West Java.  Groups of hikers, including parties of students, often climb the peak although care is needed. Mount Etna (or Etna; ; Italian: \"Etna\" ] or \"Mongibello\" ] , Sicilian: \"Mungibeddu\" ] or \"â Muntagna\", Latin: \"Aetna\" ) is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania.  It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate.  It is the tallest active volcano in Europe, currently 3329 m high, though this varies with summit eruptions.  It is the highest peak in Italy south of the Alps.  Etna covers an area of 1190 km2 with a basal circumference of 140 km.  This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius.  Only Mount Teide in Tenerife (owned by Spain) surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region.  In Greek Mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said to also be located underneath it. The Pico Cão Grande (Portuguese for \"Great Dog Peak\") is a landmark needle-shaped volcanic plug peak in São Tomé and Príncipe, in the south of São Tomé Island in Obo National Park.  It rises dramatically over 370 m (1,000 ft) above the surrounding terrain and the summit is 668 m (2,175 ft) above sea level.  The volcanic plug was formed by magma solidifying in the vent of an active volcano.  The volcanic mountain range of which it once formed a part is now extinct.  It is the 37th tallest mountain in São Tomé, and the 42nd tallest in São Tomé and Principe. Mount Shishaldin is a moderately active volcano on Unimak Island in the Aleutian Islands chain of Alaska.  It is the highest mountain peak of the Aleutian Islands.  The most symmetrical cone-shaped glacier-clad large mountain on earth, the volcano's topographic contour lines are nearly perfect circles above 6500 ft .  The lower north and south slopes are somewhat steeper than the lower eastern and western slopes.  The volcano is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes along an east–west line in the eastern half of Unimak Island.  The Aleuts named the volcano Sisquk, meaning \"mountain which points the way when I am lost.\"  The upper 2,000 meters is almost entirely covered by glacial snow and ice.  In all, Shishaldin's glacial shield covers about 35 sqmi .  It is flanked to the northwest by 24 monogenetic parasitic cones, an area blanketed by massive lava flows.  The Shishaldin cone is less than 10,000 years old and is constructed on a glacially eroded remnant of an ancestral somma and shield.  Remnants of the older ancestral volcano are exposed on the west and northeast sides at 1,500–1,800 meters elevation.  The Shishaldin edifice contains about 300 cubic kilometers of material.  A very steady steam plume rises from its small summit crater which is about 500 ft across and slightly breached along the north rim. Mount Bromo (Indonesian: \"Gunung Bromo\" ), is an active volcano and part of the Tengger massif, in East Java, Indonesia.  At 2329 m it is not the highest peak of the massif, but is the most well known.  The massif area is one of the most visited tourist attractions in East Java, Indonesia.  The volcano belongs to the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park.  The name of \"Bromo\" derived from Javanese pronunciation of Brahma, the Hindu creator god. Hualālai (pronounced ] in Hawaiian) is an active volcano on the island of Hawaiʻ i in the Hawaiian Islands.  It is the westernmost, third-youngest and the third most active of the five shield volcanoes that form the island of Hawaiʻ i, following Kīlauea and the much larger Mauna Loa.  Its peak stands 8,271 ft above sea level.  Hualālai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300,000 years ago.  Despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801, Hualālai is still considered active, and is expected to erupt again some time within the next century.  The relative unpreparedness of the residents in the area caused by the lull in activity would worsen the consequences of such an event. Nevado Ojos del Salado is a stratovolcano in the Andes on the Argentina–Chile border and the highest active volcano in the world at 6893 m .  It is also the second highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere and the highest in Chile.  It is located about 600 km north of Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere at 6961 m .

Although initially experiencing limited success, the band would later become extremely influential on the evolution of alternative rock with their two original studio albums \"Isn't Anything\" (1988) and \"Loveless\" (1991), both of which pioneered a subgenre known as shoegazing.  Shields' texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars' tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the \"glide guitar\" technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine's sound, along with his meticulous production techniques. Harry Warden is a character from the \"My Bloody Valentine\" films.  He appears in George Mihalka's \"My Bloody Valentine\" and Patrick Lussier's \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\" as one of the main antagonists. Despite the \"My Bloody Valentine\" films not launching a franchise, Harry Warden has gained a cult status in the horror genre despite only appearing in two films.  In the films, the killers including Warden, presume the identity of \"The Miner\". My Bloody Valentine, an alternative rock band from Dublin, Ireland, have recorded songs for three studio albums and a number of extended plays, singles and compilation releases.  Formed in 1983 by Kevin Shields, Colm Ó Cíosóig and David Conway, the band had a series of unsuccessful releases throughout the mid-1980s on various independent record labels.  In 1987, after the addition of bassist Debbie Googe and vocalist-guitarist Bilinda Butcher, My Bloody Valentine released \"Strawberry Wine\", \"Ecstasy\", and the 1988 EP \"You Made Me Realise\", which were predecessors to the band's debut album \"Isn't Anything\" (1988).  Considered an independent success, the band released two further EPs before \"Loveless\" (1991), their second studio album; which is considered their \"magnum opus\" and which received unanimous critical acclaim since its release.  Both albums pioneered an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing, a term coined by \"Sounds\" journalists to describe certain bands' \"motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor\".  My Bloody Valentine disbanded in 1997 after failing to utilise a third album although Kevin Shields was rumoured to have sent 60 hours worth of material to Island Records, with whom the band signed after being dropped by Creation Records in 1991.  My Bloody Valentine reunited in 2007 and began completing their third album.  The album, \"m b v\", was self-released in 2013 and received \"universal acclaim\", according to Metacritic.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_281", "context": "Arte Informale is a term coined in 1950 by the French critic Michel Tapié to refer to the art movement that began during the mid-1940s in post-World War II Europe.  This movement also paralleled the Abstract Expressionism movement that was taking place at the same time in the United States, and had ties to the Arte Povera movement.  Sometimes referred to as Tachism, Art Autre or Lyrical Abstraction, it was a type of abstraction in which form became less important than that of the expressive impulses of the artist, and was opposed to the rationalism of traditional abstraction.  The qualities of informal art explore the possibilities of gesture, materials (often non traditional), and signage as the basis of communication.  Oftentimes art characterized as informal is executed spontaneously and the approach to painting and sculpture are generally gestural, performative, expressionistic and experimental.  Certain artists such as Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri and Emilio Vedova were crucial figures of this movement. Vladimir Borisovich Yankilevsky (Russian: Владимир Борисович Янкилевский) (born February 15, 1938) is a Russian artist known mostly for his participation in the Soviet Nonconformist Art movement of the 1960s through the 1980s.  Perhaps his most famous works are his triptychs, works that are difficult to classify, occupying a unique middle ground between painting, and sculpture, similar in some ways to Rauschenberg's combines.  On the most basic level, these works use disorienting, often nightmarish imagery to paint a picture of restrictive mental states associated with daily life in the Soviet Union, and with the human condition in general.  He is also known for having participated in the Manezh Art Exhibit of 1962, during which Nikita Khrushchev famously chastised the Nonconformist Art Movement as degenerate. Nasreen Mohamedi (1937—1990) was an Indian artist best known for her line-based drawings, and is today considered one of the most essential modern artists from India.  Despite being relatively unknown outside of her native India during her lifetime, Mohamedi's work has been the subject of remarkable revitalisation in international critical circles and has received popular acclaim over the last decade.  Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in New Delhi, documenta in Kassel, Germany, and at Talwar Gallery, which organised the first solo exhibition of her work outside of India in 2003, and which has represented her estate for over a decade, in New York and in New Delhi.  Today, Mohamedi is considered one of the major figures of the art of the twentieth century. Aestheticism (also the Aesthetic Movement) is an intellectual and art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than social-political themes for literature, fine art, music and other arts.  This meant that Art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning - 'Art for Art's sake'.  It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as Oscar Wilde, but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as Harold Bloom, who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the last century. Victor Ochoa (born August 2, 1948) is an activist, painter, graphic designer and master muralist.  He has painted over 100 murals, many of them in San Diego, California.  He is considered one of the pioneers of San Diego's Chicano art movement.  Ochoa was one of the original activists at Chicano Park and a co-founder of Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park, both in San Diego.  He helped establish the influential Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronteriza (BAW/TAF).  Ochoa is also a teacher of art and Chicano heritage.  His work has been shown nationally and internationally, including at the Venice Bi-Annual, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego and in the groundbreaking exhibition, (CARA).  In addition to creating his own work, he is also a master of art preservation techniques, especially relating to murals.  He is considered to be a \"serious cultural resource in the border region. Jorge Rando (born 23 June 1941) is a Spanish painter and sculptor, considered one of the most recognised artist of the Neo-expressionist art movement.  A world class study the key global figures of Expressionism and Neoexpressionism, from the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, identified Rando as one of the best examples of neo-expressionism in the world.  The expert study selected only Rando and Miguel Barceló as the only two representatives of this artistic movement in Spain.  Therefore, in recognition to Rando's fruitful artistic career, the first Expressionist Museum in Spain bears his name Museum Jorge Rando.  Currently, the painter lives and works between Malaga, Spain and Hamburg, Germany; countries where his artistic legacy has been widely recognized.  The Museum Jorge Rando was inaugurated in Malaga,Spain in 2014 the city is the painter´s hometown, which in recent years has become a new cultural star in Europe, due to its growing number of outstanding contemporary art museums.  In Germany, the artist second home, his art work has also been recognised, since the prestigious Ernst Barlach Museum at Ratzeburg, granted a permanent exhibition room to Rando oeuvres, been the first Spanish living painter to receive such honour. Vladimir Yevgraphovich Tatlin (Russian: Влади́мир Евгра́фович Та́тлин ; 28 December [O.S. 16 December] 1885 – 31 May 1953) was a Soviet painter and architect.  With Kazimir Malevich he was one of the two most important figures in the Soviet avant-garde art movement of the 1920s, and he later became an important artist in the Constructivist movement.  He is most famous for his design for \"The Monument to the Third International\", more commonly known as \"Tatlin's Tower\", which he began in 1919. Superstroke is a term used for a contemporary art movement with its origins in South Africa.  Superstroke is one of the influential art movements regarding African modernism and abstraction.  The word \"Superstroke\" implies the super expressive brush stroke.  The Superstroke art movement was initially founded as a reaction to the impact that the Superflat art movement, founded by Takashi Murakami had on modern contemporary art. Vladimir Vidrić aka Vidra (April 20, 1875 – September 29, 1909) was a Croatian poet.  He is considered one of the major figures of the Croatian secessionist poetry. The Vienna Secession (German: \"Wiener Secession\" ; also known as \"the Union of Austrian Artists\", or \"Vereinigung Bildender Künstler Österreichs\") was an art movement formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian artists who had resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists, housed in the Vienna Künstlerhaus.

Unlike a conventional hot air balloon where people ride inside a basket, there is no basket on a hopper balloon.  Instead, the hopper pilot usually sits on a seat or wears a harness similar to a parachute harness.  Hoppers are typically flown for recreation.  These aircraft are sometimes called \"Cloud Hoppers\" or \"Cloudhoppers.\"  However, these terms formally refer to the products of a particular manufacturer, specifically Lindstrand Balloons.

The 2014 California wildfire season saw several notable wildfires ignited in the state of California, especially during the month of May, when multiple fires were ablaze concurrently in Southern California, and during September, when several massive wildfires were burning in Northern California.  In the context of the 2012–15 North American drought (especially the 2011–15 California drought), as well as powerful Santa Ana winds, weather conditions were ideal for wildfires.  The season began unusually early when a wildfire ignited on January 1, followed by 6 more fires igniting later within the same month.  During a heat wave and dry Santa Ana conditions in May 2014, multiple wildfires broke out simultaneously in San Diego County, along with several other wildfires elsewhere in California.  By mid-May, fire officials said they had already dealt with 1,400 wildfires in California in 2014 - twice the normal amount for that time of year - and a spokesman for CAL FIRE described the conditions as \"unprecedented.\"  The May 2014 San Diego County wildfires were estimated to have caused at least $60 million (2014 USD) in damage.  In late June to early August, another group of wildfires ignited across the state, some of which reached over twenty thousand acres in size.  In mid-September, the largest group of wildfires erupted, with some wildfires becoming larger than 50,000 acres in size.  In early September 2014, the Happy Complex Fire became the largest wildfire of the season, eventually topping out at 135369 acres in size on September 27.  On October 8, an aerial tanker crashed during a firefighting effort at the Dog Rock Fire, which killed the pilot and sparked a small wildfire.  From late September to late October, the latest flare-up of major wildfires were extinguished by cooler weather and precipitation.

Lauderdale takes its name from the eighteenth century owner of the property, James Lauderdale Sr.  Lauderdale purchased 366 acres on Looney Mill Creek in 1749.  By the early 1780s, he owned over a thousand acres in Botetourt County, and in 1785 he was listed as the owner of a dwelling and three other buildings.  The home Lauderdale was built in 1790 by James Lauderdale Sr.  Lauderdale Sr. settled in the area in 1730, when the region was still in the possession of the Indians.  The mansion 'Lauderdale' was built near a spring,near which it is said that Lauderdale shot and killed an Indian during an attack on his home.

The high ceilings and hand carved woodwork of the immense hallway,library, and drawing room make it one of the handsomest houses is Virginia.  The bricks on its walls were made by slaves on the place.  In 1796, Lauderdale sold 444 acres, including his residence to Col. Henry Bowyer (ca. 1760-1832).  Most references to Lauderdale incorrectly show the date of its construction as 1821, yet the Botetourt County Deed Book VI, page 36, clearly shows the subsequent owner of the mansion from Lauderdale's son, James Lauderdale Jr., a Col.

The 2014 St Helens R.F.C. season is the clubs 140th in their history; their 119th in rugby league.  The Saints will be looking to end a 6-year silverware drought this season by competing for the Super League XIX title as well as the 113th edition of the Challenge Cup.  This season marks Australian Nathan Brown's second season as head coach of the club, continuing from his first season in 2013 which ended in a 5th-place finish and an early playoff exit courtesy of an 11-10 defeat at Leeds Rhinos.  They began their season by taking on last seasons runner-up Warrington Wolves at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, which ended in an 8-38 win for Saints.  This win sent Saints on a win streak that lasted for eight Super League games before being defeated on 18 April 2014 by arch-rivals Wigan Warriors at Langtree Park in the annual Good Friday derby match.  Easter was a period to forget for the Saints as they were beaten by Widnes Vikings for their second league defeat in a row, following the Good Friday defeat to bitter rivals Wigan, and then by Leeds Rhinos in Round 5 of the Challenge Cup meaning the Saints will miss out on the trophy for a sixth year.  The Saints bounced back however on 1 May with a 48-18 win over the London Broncos.  Saints suffered another Magic Weekend to the Warrington Wolves on 18 May with the game ending 41-24 to the Wolves.  Results picked up after the Magic Weekend with two straight wins at home against Huddersfield & Salford however the Saints then traveled to Perpignan where they suffered a humiliating 42-0 loss to the Catalans Dragons.  Once again, the Saints bounced back with an impressive win over Castleford Tigers at Langtree Park and with another outstanding performance in a pulsating game at the DW Stadium against arch-rivals Wigan Warriors that ended 12-16 in favour of the Saints; the win avenging the Good Friday defeat at Langtree Park.  Following this win, Saints suffered a shock 40-10 defeat to Hull Kingston Rovers but bounced back with three straight wins before losing to Hull KR's cross-town rivals, Hull F.C., 19-12.  However, a 40-16 win over Wakefield Trinity Wildcats & an extremely tight 12-13 win over Leeds Rhinos at Headingly put the Saints in a position where a win against Warrington on 4 September would hand them their first League Leaders' Shield since the 2008 season; with Castleford Tigers being the only other team in contention for the top spot.  Despite losing their last two games of the regular season, Saints acquired the League Leaders' Shield following Castleford's failure to beat Catalans Dragons in their last game of the season; meaning that the Saints took their first piece of silverware since 2008.  The unlikely success of the 2014 season culminated in a 14-6 win over arch-rivals Wigan Warriors in the 2014 Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford making Saints the Super League champions for the first time since 2006 in an extremely lively, well-fought contest that saw Wigan player Ben Flower sent off for a sucker punch on a defenceless Lance Hohaia in the 2nd minute of the game.

Multiple citizenship, also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or dual nationality, is a person's citizenship status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states.  There is no international convention which determines the nationality or citizen status of a person, which is defined exclusively by national laws, which vary and can be inconsistent with each other.  Multiple citizenship arises because different countries use different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, criteria for citizenship.  Colloquial speech refers to people \"holding\" multiple citizenship but technically each nation makes a claim that this person be considered its national. Nationality is a legal relationship between an individual person and a state.  Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state.  What these rights and duties are vary from state to state.

Zoltán Sztáray (June 20, 1918 – April 20, 2011) was one of the better known contemporary writers of the Hungarian emigration.  He was born in Magyarcsaholy, Hungary and died in Portland, Oregon. Lajos Áprily (birth name Lajos Jékely) was a Hungarian poet and translator who won the 1954 Attila József Prize for his contributions to Hungarian literature.  Áprily was born 14 November 1887 in Brassó, Austria-Hungary (now the city of Brașov in Romania) and died 6 August 1967 in Budapest; he was the father of Zoltán Jékely (1913-1982), also a poet and translator. Currow (Irish: \"An Currach / Corra\" , meaning \"The Marsh\" ) is a rural village in County Kerry in south west Ireland, located approximately 12 km from Killarney and 18 km from Tralee.  Currow is situated on the Brown Flesk River, a tributary of the River Maine.  Currow covers 3,376 Hectares, much of the land is arable, mainly used as pasture for dairy stock.  However, there are areas of peat land, particularly to the south, where a blanket bog is located on the border with Kilcummin.  There are many old, mature trees particularly on the floodplain of the river.  Currow is mainly a residential area with close links to Castleisland.  The main industry is agriculture.  The original village grew up on both sides of the roadway to the north of Flesk Bridge, between two old estates, Dicksgrove and Parkmore, which have influenced the architectural character.  The Meredith Family were the landlords of the area, residing in the old Parkmore estate.  The first influence of the British came from the Herbert Family during the plantations.  The village escaped much of the major development experienced by many nearby villages and towns during the Celtic Tiger.  Any development is mainly one-off housing.  Currow is bordered to the west by Farranfore, to the south by Kilcummin, to the east by Scartaglin and to the north by Castleisland.  Currans lies north west of Currow, which forms the Killeentierna Parish.  Con Houlihan, a columnist with the Sunday World, once wrote how he considered Currow as his 'own favourite' village in Ireland.  Although he is undecided whether Currow is a village or a hamlet.  He also declared he would someday 'apply to be made a Freeman of Currow'.  Currow takes pride in its sporting heritage, producing several international rugby players.  The popularity of the GAA is unrivaled in the community but basketball has thrived in recent decades, particularly with juveniles, with much success at county, provincial and national level. Orléans Ward (Ward 1) is a city ward in the city of Ottawa, Canada.  It was created before the 2000 Election when the area was amalgamated into the city of Ottawa.  The ward covers much of the suburban community of Orleans in the east of the city.  Previous to that, the ward existed in the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton Council.  It contains the neighbourhoods of Convent Glen, Convent Glen South, Hiawatha Park, Orleans Wood, Riverglen, Queenswood Village, Chatelaine Village, River Walk, Queenswood Heights, Queenswood South, Fallingbrook and the eastern part of the Cardinal Creek neighbourhood (east of Trim Road).  Not all of Orleans is in the Orléans Ward, as some of it is in Cumberland Ward and Innes Ward.  It covers an area of 25.2 km. The City of Perth is a local government area and body, within the Perth metropolitan area, which is the capital of Western Australia.  The local government is commonly known as Perth City Council.  The City covers the Perth city centre and surrounding suburbs.  The City covers an area of 20.01 km2 and had an estimated population of 21,092 as at 30 June 2015.  On 1 July 2016 the City expanded, absorbing 1,247 residents from the City of Subiaco. North American area code 602 is a state of Arizona telephone area code that covers most of the city of Phoenix.  It was one of the original area codes established in October 1947 and originally covered the entire state of Arizona until 1995 when area code 520 was established as the state's second area code.  While Arizona's explosive expansion during the second half of the 20th century would have made a split necessary in any event, it was hastened by the demand for telephone lines created by the proliferation of fax machines, cell phones and dial-up Internet connections.  Many states introduced new area codes during this time frame for much the same reason.  Generally, greater Phoenix retained 602, except for some outer portions of Maricopa County that transferred to 520. Ballarat East is a suburb of Ballarat in Victoria, Australia.  Until 1921 the suburb was its own town with its own council, Ballarat East Town Council.  The suburb covers a large area east of the City of Ballarat.  It is the oldest area in Ballarat and was the site of many goldmines, as well as the Eureka Rebellion.  The population of Ballarat East at the 2016 census was 5,628.  Although amalgamation between Ballarat and Ballarat East occurred nearly a century ago the former town retains much of its shambolic character.  It is notable for its contrast with present day Ballarat.  In particular, it has windy roads which arose organically in the goldfields because the town was not planned and its has many old miner's cottages.  However, much of its public infrastructure has been demolished, including the town hall, the train station and the orphanage.  Much of the suburb is subject to heritage overlays because of its local significance, with most dwellings dating between the 1860s and 1940s. Kerepes is a city in Pest county, Budapest metropolitan area, Hungary.  It has a population of 9,903 (2008).  Olympian Zoltán Sándor was born here.

He honed his singing and songwriting prowess during his stint writing songs like Dinggin, Sikat Ako (PDA Album Vol.2 and 4 respectively), Spending My Life With You, Awit Para Sa Kanya and also wrote Yeng Constantino's hits Cool Off and Time In (from the album Salamat).  He then merged with fellow scholars to form the short lived Cebalo band which re-arranged and performed Pinoy Ako for PBB's second season. Remembrance Days is the second album by the British band The Dream Academy.  Not as successful as the band's 1985 self-titled debut, the album peaked at number 181 in the United States. The Dream Academy were an English band consisting of singer/guitarist Nick Laird-Clowes, multi-instrumentalist (chiefly oboe, Cor Anglais player) Kate St John, and keyboardist Gilbert Gabriel.  The band is most noted for their 1985 hit single \"Life in a Northern Town.\" The Cutthroats 9 is a band formed by Chris Spencer of Unsane when he moved to California after Unsane went on hiatus in 2000.  Their first single \"You Should Be Dead\"/\"Can't Do a Thing\" was released on Man's Ruin Records with Spencer on guitar/vocals, Mark Laramie (or Laramee) on bass and Billy Ropple on drums.  Their first album was called \"The Cutthroats 9\" and also came out on Man's Ruin.  The lineup for this recording featured Spencer on guitar/vocals, Unsane bassist Dave Curran, plus Mark Laramie and Will Carroll on guitar and drums respectively.  They followed it up with a six song EP that came out on Reptilian Records with Chris (guitar), Mark (bass) and Will (drums). Kate St John is a composer, arranger, producer and instrumentalist (oboe, cor anglais, accordion, saxophone and piano).  She was born in London in 1957 and was classically trained on oboe.  She gained a music degree at City University London.  Her first band was The Ravishing Beauties with Virginia Astley and Nicky Holland.  The trio joined The Teardrop Explodes in Liverpool during the winter of 1981 for a series of dates at a small clubs and a UK tour in early 1982.  During the 1980s and early 1990s she was a member of The Dream Academy with Nick Laird-Clowes and Gilbert Gabriel.  In 1985 they had a worldwide hit with \"Life In A Northern Town\" and produced three albums: \"The Dream Academy\" (1985), \"Remembrance Days\" (1987) and \"A Different Kind Of Weather\" (1990).  In the 1990s St. John was a member of Van Morrison's live band playing oboe and saxophone.  She played on 5 Van Morrison albums.  In 1994 she co-wrote and sang on 4 tracks with Roger Eno on the album \"The Familiar\" on the All Saints Label.  This led to the formation of Channel Light Vessel, a band with Kate, Roger Eno, Bill Nelson, Laraaji and Mayumi Tachibana. A Different Kind of Weather was the third and final album released by the British band, The Dream Academy.  The album saw the return of David Gilmour as the main producer, six years after he had produced their debut album.  However, the album failed to enter the charts, despite the band performing their first and only tour of the United Kingdom to promote the release of this album in 1991. Gregg Dechert (born May 11, 1952 in Listowel, Ontario, Canada) is a former member of Uriah Heep.

It was released on 15 September 1997 as the lead single from their debut studio album, \"Sunmachine\" (1998), although early editions were stated to be from an album named \"Super Dario Land\".  The song heavily samples the track \"Life in a Northern Town\" by dream pop band The Dream Academy. The Morning Lasted All Day: A Retrospective is a compilation album released by The Dream Academy in 2014.  It is the band's second compilation album, following the Japan-only release of \"Somewhere in the Sun... Best of the Dream Academy\" in 2000.  While the latter album was assembled without input from the band, \"The Morning Lasted All Day\" was compiled, annotated, and remastered by lead singer Nick Laird-Clowes.  Of the album's 24 tracks, 6 were previously unreleased.  These include the instrumental version of \"Power to Believe\" selected by John Hughes for use in \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" and \"Sunrising\", the first song recorded by the band since 1990.

Best of the Dream Academy is a compilation album released by The Dream Academy in Japan in 2000.  The compilation album contains the extended version of \"Life In A Northern Town\" and an acoustic version of \"The Party\" rather than the more common versions.  At the time of its release, Nick Laird-Clowes revealed that the band actually had no involvement with the album, and he went on further to say that they weren’t even informed by Warners that a compilation album was being made.  His former label boss, Alan McGee, then of Creation Records, was the one who actually brought him home a copy when he was visiting Japan on business.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_298", "context": "Feliksas Vaitkus (Felix Waitkus) (1907–1956) was an American born Lithuanan pilot and the sixth pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic. Amelia Mary Earhart ( , born July 24, 1897; disappeared July 2, 1937) was an American aviation pioneer and author.  Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.  She received the U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment.  She set many other records, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.  In 1935, Earhart became a visiting faculty member at Purdue University as an advisor to aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to women students.  She was also a member of the National Woman's Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. James Dunn Mathis at age 16 was the youngest pilot to fly solo across the United States.  He was formerly the Republican candidate for the United States Congress in Maryland's 2nd congressional district. Betty Miller (born April 6, 1926) is the first female pilot to fly solo across the Pacific Ocean, which she did in May 1963.  Specifically, she flew from Oakland, California, USA to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, to deliver the plane (a twin-engine Piper) to a buyer.  The flight also made her the first woman to fly solo from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii which she did in just over 17 hours.  She started the first leg of the epic flight on April 25th.1963 from Oakland California and took over 17 hours to reach Honolulu.  On May 5th, she left Honolulu for the second leg of her flight to Canton Island, next Fiji and then New Caledonia.  She landed in Brisbane, Australia, on May 13 1963, Betty climbed out of the plane wearing a cotton dress and high heels to the cheers of a large crowd.  The total elapsed flying time for the flight over the Pacific was 51 hours, 38 minutes.  In recognition of her flight, she received the Federal Aviation Administration’s Gold Medal for Exceptional Service from President Kennedy, and later President Johnson presented her with the Harmon International Trophy for Aviatrix of the Year (1963). Herbert John Louis Hinkler (8 December 1892 – 7 January 1933), better known as Bert Hinkler, was a pioneer Australian aviator (dubbed \"Australian Lone Eagle\") and inventor.  He designed and built early aircraft before being the first person to fly solo from England to Australia, and the first person to fly solo across the Southern Atlantic Ocean.  He married in 1932 at the age of 39, and died less than a year later after crashing into remote countryside near Florence, Italy during a solo flight record attempt. Lindbergh High School is a (senior) high school located in the southeastern section of Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, in the Renton School District.  It is named after Charles A. Lindbergh, the famous aviator who was first to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.  The school was founded in 1972.  Freshmen, sophomores and juniors attended the first year, making the class of 1974 the first to graduate.  Lindbergh's school motto is \"ad astra\", which is Latin for \"to the stars\".  The crest features the Spirit of St. Louis (the plane that Charles Lindbergh flew), and the school's motto flanked by stars with the dates 1927 and 1972, respectively. Geraldine \"Jerrie\" Fredritz Mock (November 22, 1925 – September 30, 2014) was the first woman to fly solo around the world, which she did in 1964.  She flew a single engine Cessna 180 (registered N1538C) christened the \"Spirit of Columbus\" and nicknamed \"Charlie.\"  The trip began March 19, 1964, in Columbus, Ohio, and ended April 17, 1964, in Columbus, Ohio, and took 29 days, 21 stopovers and almost 22860 mi .  An almost forgotten part of this flight is the \"race\" that developed between Jerrie Mock and Joan Merriam Smith who had flown from a field near San Francisco CA on March 17, 1964.  Joan's departure date and flight path was the same as the aviator Amelia Earhart's last flight and though not in direct competition with each other, media coverage soon began tracking the progress of each pilot fascinated with who would complete the journey first.  The story of this race is told in a book written by Taylor Phillips entitled, \"Racing to Greet the Sun, Jerrie Mock and Joan Merriam Smith Duel to Become the First Woman to Solo Around the World\".  Jerrie Mock was subsequently awarded the Louis Blériot medal from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1965.  In 1970 she published the story of her round-the-world flight in the book \"Three-Eight Charlie\".  While that book is now out of print, a 50th anniversary edition was later published including maps, weather charts and photos.  \"Three-Eight Charlie\" is a reference to the call sign, N1538C, of the Cessna 180 Skywagon Mock used to fly around the world.  Before her death, Mock, mother of three children, resided in Quincy, Florida; northwest of the state capital, Tallahassee. Beryl Markham (née Clutterbuck, 26 October 1902 – 3 August 1986) was a British-born Kenyan aviator (one of the first bush pilots), adventurer, racehorse trainer and author.  She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west.  She wrote about her adventures in her memoir, \"West with the Night\". The Lindbergh operation was a complete tele-surgical operation carried out by a team of French surgeons located in New York on a patient in Strasbourg, France (over a distance of several thousand miles) using telecommunications solutions based on high-speed services and sophisticated Zeus surgical robot.  The operation was performed successfully on September 7, 2001 by Professor Jacques Marescaux and his team from the IRCAD (Institute for Research into Cancer of the Digestive System).  This was the first time in medical history that a technical solution proved capable of reducing the time delay inherent to long distance transmissions sufficiently to make this type of procedure possible.  The name was derived from that of American aviator Charles Lindbergh, because he was the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Victoria Murden McClure (born March 6, 1963) is an explorer who was the first woman and the first American to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean, which she did in 1999.  (She claims she is an explorer, but not an \"adventurer.\")  She was also the first woman and first American to ski to the geographic South Pole.  She is the president of Spalding University.

It would become Social Distortion's first time in South America in their entire career.  Frontman Mike Ness had this to say: White Light, White Heat, White Trash is the fifth album by American punk rock band, Social Distortion, released on September 17, 1996, by Epic Records.  The album was produced by Michael Beinhorn.  \"White Light, White Heat, White Trash\" is the last Social Distortion studio album to feature guitarist Dennis Danell who died on February 29, 2000, of a cerebral aneurysm at the age of 38.  He did however appear on live album \"Live at the Roxy\" in 1998.  It is also the band's last release on Epic Records.  The album received Social Distortion's highest chart position at the time, entering the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart at #27.  In the first week of its release, \"White Light, White Heat, White Trash\" sold 30,000 copies.  Stylistically, the album is harder and considered a return to their punk roots. The Social Distortion 2001 Tour was a concert tour by Social Distortion.  It was their first tour in three years as Mike Ness was busy with his solo project, touring throughout 1999 and the rest of the band was off doing their own thing.  Dennis Danell was working as a producer in the Orange County area for up-and-coming punk bands and he was also in the process of recording demos for his side project.  John Maurer had started his own side band as well, Foxy.  Foxy had just released its debut album.  On this tour, the band premiered new songs off of the Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll album like, \"Footprints On My Ceiling\", \"I Wasn't Born to Follow\" and \"Angel's Wings\" and \"Road Zombie\", although, \"Angel's Wings\" sounded almost different with different lyrics than its studio counterpart.  They even played a couple songs that were rare to hear at a Social Distortion concert those days, \"Hour of Darkness\", \"Backstreet Girl\", \"I Won't Run No More\", \"When She Begins\", \"King of Fools\" and \"Down On the World Again\".  This was also one of the few tours where Social Distortion did not have ANY opening acts. Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on January 18, 2011.  It is the band's first album recorded with bassist Brent Harding, their first album of new material since 2004's \"Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll\", and their first release on Epitaph Records.  Work on the album began in 2006 and it was originally forecast for a 2007 release, but was pushed back several times while the band continued touring and writing new material.  After four years of writing, Social Distortion recorded the album from February to July 2010 at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California.  Drummer Atom Willard left the group during the recording sessions in favor of his other band, Angels & Airwaves.  He was temporarily replaced by Scott Reeder before David Hidalgo, Jr. joined as the band's new permanent drummer.  Despite being listed as a band member on the album, Hidalgo did not actually play on it; instead, the band hired session musician Josh Freese to record the drum tracks. D.I. is a Southern California punk band featuring ex-Adolescents and Social Distortion drummer Casey Royer on vocals.  Royer formed the band after he and former Social Distortion original member Rikk Agnew (also formerly of Christian Death), left the original Mike Ness Social Distortion crew. The Social Distortion 2010 Tour was a tour by Social Distortion and was the first tour to have David Hidalgo, Jr. on the drums.  After spending two weeks in rehearsal, the band officially kicked off the tour on July 17, 2010 in Quebec City at the Festival d'été de Québec.  During this tour, in late October, the band premiered Machine Gun Blues, the lead single from \"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\". Social Distortion is the eponymous third studio album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on March 27, 1990 through Epic Records, their first recording on that label.  The album furthered the rockabilly, blues and country music experimentation of their previous album with songs like \"Drug Train\" and the radio hit \"Ball and Chain\". The Social Distortion Summer Tour is a concert tour that will take place in 2013.  Social Distortion will kick off the tour with two appearances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 14 and 21.  Some of the dates on the tour are rescheduled shows from fall 2012 that were cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.  The band will also make appearances at the annual Hootenanny at Oak Valley Ranch in California, their first as Social Distortion since 2007.  Mike Ness made an appearance at the 2008 festival, but he was touring with his solo band.  The band will also appear at the Free Press Summer Fest in Houston, Texas, and at this year's North by Northeast in Toronto. The Winter Tour (also known as \"House of Blues Residency\" was a tour by Social Distortion.  As its name applies, most of the shows were based out of the House of Blues in Orange County (Anaheim, San Diego, West Hollywood) with a couple of shows heading out to Las Vegas and Tempe, Arizona.  Even though similar, this tour was not a part of the Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes tour, as most of the material played here was pulled from most of the band's catalog.  This is also not the first time Social Distortion has done a tour like this, it has been done before numerous times since 2001.  As with previous House of Blues tours, the band played rare songs and new songs and brought out guests this time, such as Billy Gibbons and Mike Ness' own son Julian Ness.  They also brought out Eric \"Jailhouse Blues\" Von Herzen who played harp for \"It Coulda Been Me\" and \"Drug Train\" on Social Distortion (album) and they also played ZZ Top's La Grange (song) with Billy Gibbons.  The band also premiered songs like \"Far Side of Nowhere\", \"Writing On the Wall\" and performed songs that have not been played in a while like \"It Coulda Been Me\", \"99 to Life\", \"Footprints On My Ceiling\", \"Hour of Darkness\", \"Diamond In the Rough\" and even played the White Light, White Heat, White Trash album in its entirety at some shows. Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll is the sixth album by American punk rock band Social Distortion.  It is their first studio album in eight years, since the release of \"White Light, White Heat, White Trash\" in 1996, the longest gap between Social Distortion's studio albums to date.  The album was originally scheduled to be released in the fall of 2000, but was not yet completed, and it was officially released on September 28, 2004.  A great deal of the album is a musical eulogy to former guitarist Dennis Danell, who died in 2000.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_300", "context": "The Ramesseum is the memorial temple (or mortuary temple) of Pharaoh Ramesses II (\"Ramesses the Great\", also spelled \"Ramses\" and \"Rameses\").  It is located in the Theban necropolis in Upper Egypt, across the River Nile from the modern city of Luxor.  The name – or at least its French form, Rhamesséion – was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the hieroglyphs making up Ramesses's names and titles on the walls.  It was originally called the \"House of millions of years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amon.\"  Usermaatra-setepenra was the prenomen of Ramesses II. Pareherwenemef (“Re is with his left arm”) was an ancient Egyptian prince of the 20th dynasty, a son of pharaoh Ramesses III.  Just like several of his brothers, he was named after a son of Ramesses II, whom Ramesses III tried to emulate (see Pareherwenemef).  He is depicted in his father's mortuary temple at Medinet Habu.  Both he and his brother Khaemwaset are called firstborn sons of the king; they were possibly the firstborns of different wives.  He was buried in QV42. The Turin King List, also known as the Turin Royal Canon, is an ancient Egyptian hieratic papyrus thought to date from the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II, now in the Museo Egizio (Egyptian Museum) in Turin.  The papyrus is the most extensive list available of kings compiled by the ancient Egyptians, and is the basis for most chronology before the reign of Ramesses II. Wadi es-Sebua, or Valley of the Lions (so-called because of the sphinx-lined approach to the temple forecourts) (Arab: وادي السبوع), is the site of two New Kingdom Egyptian temples, including one speos temple constructed by the 19th dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II, in Lower Nubia.  The first temple was built by the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep III and subsequently restored by Ramesses II.  In its first stage, this temple \"consisted of a rock-cut sanctuary (about 3 m by 2 m) fronted by a brick-built pylon, a court and a hall, partly painted with wall paintings.\"  The temple was perhaps dedicated to one of the local Nubian forms of Horus, but his representations were altered to Amun at a later point in time.  During the Amarna period, images of Amun were attacked and the decorations deteriorated but Ramesses II later restored and extended Amenhotep III's temple by building structures in front of the pylon. The Great and Small Temples in Abu Simbel are massive rock-cut temples built by Pharaoh Ramesses II during Dynasty 19 of the New Kingdom.  They were originally built in Nubia next to the Second Cataract, but since the construction of the Aswan High Dam, they have been moved to their present location.  They were built both to show Egypt’s influence over rich Nubia and to show Ramesses II as a god.  Today they are preserved as a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site “Nubian Monuments.” QV66 is the tomb of Nefertari, the Great Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses II, in Egypt's Valley of the Queens.  It was discovered by Ernesto Schiaparelli (the director of the Egyptian Museum in Turin) in 1904.  It is called the Sistine Chapel of Ancient Egypt.  Nefertari, which means \"beautiful companion\", was Ramesses II's favorite wife; he went out of his way to make this obvious, referring to her as \"the one for whom the sun shines\" in his writings, built the Temple of Hathor to idolize her as a deity, and commissioned portraiture wall paintings.  In the Valley of the Queens, Nefertari's tomb once held the mummified body and representative symbolisms of her, like what most Egyptian tombs consisted of.  Now, everything had been looted except for two thirds of the 5,200 square feet of wall paintings.  For what still remains, these wall paintings characterized Nefertari's character.  Her face was given a lot of attention to emphasize her beauty, especially the shape of her eyes, the blush of her cheeks, and her eyebrows.  Some paintings were full of lines and color of red, blue, yellow, and green that portrayed exquisite directions to navigating through the afterlife to paradise. The Temple of Beit el-Wali is a rock-cut Ancient Egyptian temple in Nubia which was built by Pharaoh Ramesses II and dedicated to the deities of Amun-Re, Re-Horakhti, Khnum and Anuket.  It was the first in a series of temples built by Ramesses II in this region; its name Beit el-Wali means 'House of the Holy Man' and may indicate its previous use as by a Christian hermit at some point in time.  The temple was relocated during the 1960s as a result of the Aswan High Dam project and moved towards higher ground along with the Temple of Kalabsha.  This move was coordinated with a team of Polish archaeologists financed jointly by a Swiss and Chicago Institute respectively.  The temple was located 50 kilometres south of Aswan. The Temple of Derr or el-Derr is a \"speos\" or rock-cut Egyptian temple in Lower Nubia.  It was built during the 19th Dynasty by Pharaoh Ramesses II.  It is the only rock-cut temple in Nubia which was constructed by this pharaoh on the right (or east) bank of the Nile and used to stand at el-Derr.  The temple's unique position \"was probably because the river on its approach to the Korosko bend flows in an 'unnatural' southeasterly direction.\"  The Derr structure was known in ancient times as 'The \"Temple of Ri'amsese-meryamun\" [Ramesses II] \"in the Domain of Re\" ' and was dedicated to the god Ra-Horakhty.  Scholars disagree over its precise construction date: the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal states that it was built in the thirteenth year of Ramesses II, presumably to coincide with his first royal jubilee.  In contrast, John Baines and Jaromír Málek write that the temple of Derr \"was built in the second half of the king's reign\", likely because its \"plan and decoration resembles the Great Temple of Abu Simbel (minus the colossal seated statues against the facade).\"  Abu Simbel was built between Year 24 and Year 31 of Ramesses' reign.  According to Joyce Tyldesley, the Temple of Derr was built by Setau, who is known to have served as Ramesses' Viceroy of Kush or Nubia between Year 38 to 63 of this pharaoh's reign. The Min festival was an ancient Egyptian ceremony which was held to celebrate the continued rule of a pharaoh.  It dates back to Predynastic Egypt and was still very popular during the 19th dynasty reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II.  The festival was connected with the worship of the king and was held in the last month of the summer.  It was carried out by the king himself, followed by his wife, royal family, and the court.  When the king entered the sanctuary of the deity Min, he brought offerings and burning incense.  Then, the standing god was carried out of the temple on a shield carried by 22 priests.  In front of the statue of the god there were also two small seated statues of the pharaoh.  In front of the god Min there was a large ceremonial procession that included dancers and priests.  In front of them was a king with a white bull that was wearing a solar disc between its horns.  When the god arrived at the end of the procession, he was given sacrificial offerings from the pharaoh.  At the end of the festival, the pharaoh was given a bundle of cereal that symbolised fertility.

Kentucky Common Beer is a once-popular style of ale from the area in and around Louisville, Kentucky from the 1850s until Prohibition.  This style is rarely brewed commercially today.  It was also locally known as \"Dark Cream Common Beer\", \"Cream Beer\" or \"Common Beer\".  The beer was top-fermented and wasn't krausened, i.e., it was fermented once and sent out for sale which meant the gravity would be moderate, the carbonation low and the taste full and sweetish.  Like cream ale, it was consumed fresh, usually as draught beer.  In 1913 it was estimated that 80% of the beer consumed in Louisville was of this type.  Many local breweries made this style of beer exclusively. Heavy Seas Beer is brewed by Clipper City Brewing Company, in Baltimore, Maryland.  The brewery was established by Hugh Sisson in 1995.

As Malawi shares a large border with Mozambique, much of the substance of their foreign relations pertain to the border separating the two nations.  Both of the sovereign states have amicably agreed that lacustrine borders on Lake Malawi remain the largest priority between the two countries, as the exploitation of natural resources within the waters of Lake Malawi remain an issue the two countries continue to resolve.  The moment considered an act of generosity and sympathy within the two countries relations is when, during the Mozambique Civil War, Malawi housed over one million Mozambican refugees between 1985 and 1995.  After this gesture, Malawian relations with Mozambique crumbled under the tenure of Bingu wa Mutharika, notoriously reaching a nadir when Malawian police launched a raid into Mozambique's territory.

The single was originally released under the title \"A Breath Taking, First Sight Soul Shaking, One Night Love Making, Next Day Heartbreaking Guy\" by The Supremes, but was shortened after its official release.  All three Supremes members - Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson - sung the chorus with the original title together. \"Up the Ladder to the Roof\" is a 1970 hit single recorded by The Supremes for the Motown label.  It was the first Supremes single to feature new lead singer Jean Terrell in place of Diana Ross, who officially left the group for a solo career two weeks before the recording of this song in January 1970.  This song also marks a number of other firsts: it is the first Supremes single since \"The Happening\" in 1967 to be released under the name \"The Supremes\" instead of \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\", the first Supremes single solely produced by Norman Whitfield associate Frank Wilson, and the first Supremes single to make the United Kingdom Top 10 since \"Reflections\" in 1967. Together, released by Motown in 1969 (catalog number MS 692), was the second and final duets studio album combining Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations into an eight-person Motown act.  Like the first duets LP, \"Diana Ross & the Supremes Join The Temptations\", it is composed almost entirely of covers, including versions of The Band's \"The Weight\", Sly & the Family Stone's \"Sing a Simple Song\", Frankie Valli's \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" (featuring Mary Wilson leading, in preparation for Ross' departure from the Supremes} and Motown songs like \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" and \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\".  \"The Weight\" was the only single in the US, and failed to make it into the American Top 40. \" Why (Must We Fall in Love)\", a UK exclusive single, was a Top 40 hit on the UK singles charts. Farewell is a 1970 live album by Diana Ross & the Supremes.  The album was recorded over the course of the group's final engagement together at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, including the final night on January 14, 1970.  The show marked Diana Ross' penultimate performance with fellow Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong.  At the conclusion of the show, new Supremes lead singer Jean Terrell was brought onstage and introduced to the audience. Let the Sunshine In is the sixteenth studio album by Diana Ross & the Supremes recorded and released by Motown in 1969.  It contains the hit single \"I'm Livin' in Shame\" (the sequel to 1968's number-one hit \"Love Child\"), \"The Composer,\" a Smokey Robinson composition that peaked at #27, and \"No Matter What Sign You Are,\" - a single produced by Motown chief Berry Gordy that failed to crack to Top 30 (peaking at #31).  Though the album was released when the group consisted of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, original founding member Florence Ballard (whom Birdsong replaced) appears on two songs.  One track from this album, \"Let The Music Play\" was an outtake from the \"I Hear a Symphony\" album recording sessions and therefore features backing by Ballard, who was fired in 1967, two years prior to the release of this album.  The other track, \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,\" was recorded by the Supremes in 1966.  According to Motown data this album sold over 625,000 copies in the USA. Diana Ross & the Supremes: Greatest Hits Vol.  3 is a 1969 compilation album by Diana Ross & the Supremes, released on the Motown label.  It features all of the hits released by the group between 1967 and 1969 save for the Supremes/Temptations duet singles.  After Florence Ballard's mid-1967 departure from the group, Supremes singles were recorded by Diana Ross with session singers The Andantes on backgrounds instead of new Supreme Cindy Birdsong and founding member Mary Wilson, including \"Love Child\" and \"Someday We'll Be Together\" (Birdsong's voice in fact does not appear on this album). The Supremes at the Copa is a live album by Motown singing group The Supremes, recorded during their debut engagement at the prestigious Copacabana nightclub in New York City.  Released in the late fall of 1965, \"At the Copa\" was the first live album issued by The Supremes, and the only live album issued by the group's best-known lineup of Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson. \"Someday We'll Be Together\" is a song written by Johnny Bristol, Jackey Beavers, and Harvey Fuqua and made popular as the last of twelve American number-one pop singles for Diana Ross & the Supremes on the Motown label.  Although it was released as the final Supremes song featuring Diana Ross, who left the group for a solo career in January 1970, it was recorded as Ross' first solo single and Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not sing on the recording.  Both appear on the B-side, \"He's My Sunny Boy.\" \"After All\" is a 1960 song written by Smokey Robinson and originally recorded and released by The Miracles on the Tamla label.  It was later covered as an unreleased single by The Supremes for Tamla; it was canceled in favor of the single \"Buttered Popcorn\", and their cover wasn't released until it appeared on the 2000 box set, \"The Supremes\".  The song is noted for both groups' unusual choices for leads.  For the Miracles' version it serves as a rare lead for Claudette Rogers Robinson, instead of the group’s main lead, Claudette's husband, Smokey Robinson.  In the Supremes' case it is their only single to feature Barbara Martin singing on lead vocals (although she does have a spoken line during the song \"(He's) Seventeen\").  Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, and Diana Ross sing verses, and Martin sings the bridge (usually Ballard or Ross was given the lead on the group's recordings at that time).  \"After All\" was also later covered by The Marvelettes, in the early 1970s, with group member Wanda Young Rogers as lead.  (There's a connection to the two previous groups in that Wanda Young was the wife of Miracles member Bobby Rogers, and she was the only member of The Marvelettes on the song—as with the late-1960s singles of The Supremes, The Andantes served as background singers.)  Their version appears on the album \"The Return of the Marvelettes\", and later became the group's belated final single (it failed to chart). Live at London's Talk of the Town is a 1968 live album released by Diana Ross & the Supremes on the Motown label, recorded at the \"Talk of the Town\" nightclub.  This performance marked the first time that new member Cindy Birdsong had performed overseas with original Supremes Diana Ross and Mary Wilson, a year after original founding member Florence Ballard was ousted.  The group performed a variation of standards, show tunes, and their own classics with British rock stars Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney reportedly in attendance.  The songs recorded are from the group's 1968 European tour.  That European tour also garnered a famous Swedish television special that was used as a catalyst to promote this album.", "com_question": "What year was Mary Wilson born?

She is known for playing the roles of Ruby Taylor in \"Do No Harm\", Ashley in \"Sinister\", a young version of Piper in \"Orange is the New Black\" and Ivy Pepper a version of Pamela Isley in the first two seasons of \"Gotham\", appearing in a cameo role in the show's third season to pass the role to actress Maggie Geha. Arnold Rampersad (born 13 November 1941) is a biographer and literary critic, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago and moved to the US in 1965.  The first volume (1986) of his \"Life of Langston Hughes\" was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and his \"Ralph Ellison: A Biography\" was a finalist for the 2007 National Book Award. Juneteenth is Ralph Ellison's second novel, published posthumously in 1999 as a 368-page condensation of over 2000 pages written by him over a period of forty years.  It was originally written without any real organization, and Ellison's longtime friend, biographer and critic John F. Callahan put the novel together, editing it in the way he thought Ellison would want it to be written. \"A Party Down at the Square\" is a short story by the American writer Ralph Ellison, first published in 1997, three years after the author's death.  It is a story of a Deep South lynching as perceived by a white boy from Cincinnati, Ohio. The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African-American Literary Criticism is a work of literary criticism and theory by American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. first published in 1988.  The book traces the folkloric origins of the African-American cultural practice of “signifying” and uses the concept of Signifyin(g) to analyze the interplay between texts of prominent African-American writers, specifically Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston and Ishmael Reed. William Gardner Smith (February 6, 1927 – November 5, 1974) was an American journalist, novelist, and editor.  Smith is linked to the black social protest novel tradition of the 1940s and the 1950s, a movement that became synonymous with writers such as Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Willard Motley, and Ann Petry.  Smith's third book, \"South Street\" (1954), is considered to be one of the first black militant protest novels.  His last published novel, \"The Stone Face\" (1963), in its account of the Paris massacre of 1961, \"stand[s] as one of the few representations of the event available all the way up until the early 1990s\".", "com_question": "When was Ralph Ellison born?

The son and successor of Cadfan ap Iago, he is best remembered as the King of the Britons who invaded and conquered the Kingdom of Northumbria, defeating and killing its king, Edwin, prior to his own death in battle against Oswald of Bernicia.  His conquest of Northumbria, which he held for a year or two after Edwin died, made him the last Briton to hold substantial territory in eastern Britain until the rise of the House of Tudor.  He was thereafter remembered as a national hero by the Britons and as a tyrant by the Anglo-Saxons of Northumbria. Cnut (Old Norse: \"Knútr\" ) was a Norse King of Northumbria.  Numismatic evidence suggests he ruled from around 900 until 905, succeeding Siefredus. Blácaire mac Gofraid (Old Norse: \"Blákári Guðrøðsson\" ; died 948) was a Viking leader who ruled Dublin in the 10th century.  He succeeded his brother Amlaíb mac Gofraid as king in 939 after the latter left Dublin to rule Northumbria.  In the early years of his reign Blácaire led raids on important Christian sites at Clonmacnoise and Armagh, but repeated attacks by the Irish of Leinster in 943 and 944 led to the sack of Dublin.  A year later Blácaire was replaced as King of Dublin (perhaps because of his inability to defend the city) by his cousin Amlaíb Cuarán, who had succeeded Blácaire's brother in Northumbria in 941, but had been driven out in 944. EX-treme Dating is an American reality television show that paired two people (one man and one woman) on a blind date.  The couple was chaperoned on the date by two of the person's ex-partners.  They talked to the other person via an earpiece, feeding hints for conversation topics and comments on the date itself.  At the end of the date, one person waited for a limousine.  If the other person was in the car, the couple got a second date paid for by the show.  If the person's ex-partners were in the car, the ex-partners themselves won a prize. Wilfrid (c.  633 – c. 709) was an English bishop and saint.  Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon.  In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted.  His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria.  Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time.  During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop.  Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria. Eadwulf Cudel or Cutel (meaning cuttlefish) was Earl of Bernicia (or Bamburgh) in the early eleventh century.  Following the destruction of the kingdom of Northumbria by the Vikings in 867, they established the Kingdom of York in southern Northumbria, but English rulers held on in the north, the former kingdom of Bernicia, from their base at Bamburgh.  They were variously described as earls or ealdormen or high-reeves, and their independence from the kings of England and Scotland is uncertain.  Uhtred the Bold and Eadwulf Cudel were sons of Waltheof, earl of Bamburgh, who died in 1006.  He was succeeded by Uhtred, who was appointed by Æthelred the Unready as earl of the whole of Northumbria.  Uhtred was murdered in 1016, and king Cnut then appointed Erik, son of Hakon, earl at York, while Eadwulf succeeded at Bamburgh. Olaf Guthfrithson (Old Norse: \"Óláfr Guðrøðsson\" ; ; Old Irish: \"Amlaíb mac Gofraid\" ; died 941) was a Viking leader who ruled Dublin and Viking Northumbria in the 10th century.  He was the son of Gofraid ua Ímair and great-grandson of Ímar, making him one of the Uí Ímair.  Olaf succeeded his father as King of Dublin in 934 and succeeded in establishing dominance over the Vikings of Limerick when he captured their king, Amlaíb Cenncairech, in 937.  That same year he allied with Constantine II of Scotland in an attempt to reclaim the Kingdom of Northumbria which his father had ruled briefly in 927.  The forces of Olaf and Constantine were defeated by the English led by Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh. Eadwulf or Eadulf (died 913) was a ruler in Northumbria in the early tenth century.  According to genealogy of Waltheof, Earl of Northampton (and Northumbria), Eadwulf was the son of Æthelthryth daughter of Ælla, King of Northumbria--though this genealogy is not a contemporary one. Gofraid ua Ímair (Old Norse: \"Guðrøðr\" , died 934) was a Viking leader who ruled Dublin and briefly Viking Northumbria in the early 10th century.  He was a grandson of Ímar and a member of the Uí Ímair.  Gofraid was most probably among those Vikings expelled from Dublin in 902, whereafter he helped his kinsman Ragnall conquer Northumbria.  Another kinsman, Sitric Cáech, became ruler of Dublin around the same time.  Ragnall died in 920, and so the following year Sitric left Dublin to rule in Northumbria, and Gofraid succeeded Sitric as ruler of Dublin.  Sitric's early reign was marked by raids he conducted against the native Irish, including one at Armagh. Siefredus (Old Norse: \"Sigfrøðr\" ) was a Norse King of Northumbria.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_313", "context": "Danish dialects are the regional and local varieties of the Danish language.  Danish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects.  Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.  Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas: Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish and Bornholmian.  Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to Sweden and subsequently assimilated to Standard Swedish.  Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic.  Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn and Lolland-Falster dialect areas - each with addition internal variation. Rhine Franconian (German:    ), or Rhenish Franconian, is a dialect family of West Central German.  It comprises the German dialects spoken across the western regions of the states of Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, northwest Baden-Wurttemberg, and Hesse in Germany.  It is also spoken in northeast France, in the eastern part of the département of Moselle in the Lorraine region, and in the north-west part of Bas-Rhin in Alsace.  To the north, it is bounded by the Sankt Goar line (“\"das/dat\" line”) which separates it from Moselle Franconian; to the south, it is bounded by the Main line which is also referred to as the \"Speyer line\" which separates it from the Upper German dialects. Palatine German or Pfaelzisch (\"Pälzisch\"; German: \"Pfälzisch\" ) is a West Franconian dialect of German which is spoken in the Upper Rhine Valley roughly in an area between the cities of Zweibrücken, Kaiserslautern, Alzey, Worms, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Speyer, Landau, Wörth am Rhein and the border to the Alsace region in France but also beyond.  Pennsylvania German, or Pennsylvania Dutch is descended primarily from the Palatine German dialects spoken by Germans who immigrated to North America from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries and who chose to maintain their native language.  Danube Swabians in Croatia and Serbia also use many elements of it.  Normally, one distinguishes the Pfälzisch spoken in the western part of the Palatinate (Westpfälzisch) and the Pfälzisch spoken in the eastern part of the Palatinate (Vorderpfälzisch).  Some examples of the differences between High German and Pfälzisch are: South Bergish (German: \"Südbergische Dialekte \") or Upper Bergish (German: \"Oberbergische Dialekte \") is a group of German dialects of the Bergisches Land Region East of the Rhine and approximately south of the Wupper and north of the Sieg.  These dialects are part of the Ripuarian group and thus are also called East Ripuarian.  Ripuarian dialects are also spoken west of the Rhine up to the German border, and in some small areas next to the respective borders in Belgium and in the Netherlands.  Ripuarian Bergish dialects belong to the Middle German group, and thus are varieties of High German, where they belong to the northmost ones.  In the North, they border to the East Bergish and the West Bergish aka Low Bergish language groups, which are part of the Low Franconian group like Dutch. Low Bergish, or Western Bergish, is a group of local languages of the Bergisches Land Region east of the Rhine in West Germany.  It is part of the Limburgish language group, which extends far beyond the rivers Rhine and Maas into the Netherlands and Belgium.  They are also part of the East Limburgish group, that is, the varieties of Limbugish spoken in Germany.  They combine Low Franconian properties with some Ripuarian properties and are seen as the transitory dialects between them in the dialect continuum of Dutch and German. Hessen (German: \"Hessisch\" ) is a West Central German group of dialects of the German language in the central German state of Hessen.  The dialect most similar to Hessen is Palatinate German (Ger.: \"Pfälzisch\", pronounced ] ) of the Rhine Franconian sub-family.  However, the Hessen dialects have some features which set them somewhat apart from other West-Central German dialects. Franconian (German: \"Fränkisch\" ; Dutch: \"Frankisch\" ) includes a number of West Germanic languages and dialects possibly derived from the languages and dialects originally spoken by the Franks from their ethnogenesis in the 3rd century AD.  The languages that evolved in the northern and eastern lands of Francia included Low Franconian, of which present-day Dutch is the primary member, the West Central German Rhine Franconian and Central Franconian dialects (including Luxembourgish), as well as transitional High Franconian German dialects.  Linguists have different views about whether these languages and dialects have descended from a single Franconian proto-language, also known as Istvaeonic. Frankish (reconstructed Frankish: \"*Frenkisk\"), Old Franconian or Old Frankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between the 4th and 8th century.  The language itself is poorly attested, but it gave rise to numerous loanwords in Old French.  Old Dutch is the term for the Old Franconian dialects spoken in the Low Countries, ie.  in present-day Belgium, in the present Netherlands and Western parts of today's Germany until about the 12th century when it evolved into Middle Dutch. Meuse-Rhenish (German: \"Rheinmaasländisch\", Dutch: \"Maas-Rijnlands\", and French: \"francique rhéno-mosan\") is a modern term that refers to the literature written in the Middle Ages in the greater Meuse-Rhine area.  This area stretches in the northern triangle roughly between the rivers Meuse (in Belgium and the Netherlands) and Rhine (in Germany).  It also applies to the Low Franconian dialects that have been spoken in that area in continuation from mediaeval times up to now. In linguistics, Old Dutch or Old Low Franconian is the set of Franconian dialects (i.e. dialects that evolved from Frankish) spoken in the Low Countries during the Early Middle Ages, from around the 5th to the 12th century.  Old Dutch is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and Old Dutch loanwords in French.", "com_question": "What are the subgroups of Jutlandic dialects?

This span was part of a seven-span approach to one of the first bridges constructed over the Mississippi River.  It was part of a railroad bridge that connected Dubuque with Dunleith, Illinois, now known as East Dubuque.  The bridge was fabricated by the Keystone Bridge Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Andrew Carnegie himself traveled to Dubuque to advocate for his company to build the bridge.  It was erected by Reynolds, Saulpaugh and Company of Rock Island, Illinois.  The approach, of which this iron truss was a part, was completed in 1872.  It was used by the Illinois Central and other railroads. The Wabash Railroad Bridge is a historic structure located south of Pella, Iowa, United States.  It spans the Des Moines River for 561 ft .  The Des Moines and St. Louis Railroad (D&S) was built through the central part of Marion County in 1882.  This bridge was probably built at that time.  It is a three span, wrought iron, Pratt through truss manufactured by the Carnegie Steel Company.  The Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railroad, the Wabash Railroad, eventually acquired the D&S and this bridge.  It remained in use as a railroad bridge until about 1946 when the county acquired the bridge and the right-of-way for a county road.  They rehabilitated it in 1951, replacing part of the substructure.  The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Young's High Bridge is a former railroad bridge near Tyrone, Kentucky, USA, that spans the Kentucky River between Anderson County, Kentucky and Woodford County, Kentucky for the Louisville Southern Railroad.  The cantilever bridge, named in honor of William Bennett Henderson Young, was constructed in 1889, and the first train crossed over on August 24, 1889.

The Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1 or BNSF Railway Bridge 5.1, also known as the St. Johns Railroad Bridge or the Willamette River Railroad Bridge, is a through truss railway bridge with a vertical lift that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States.  Built by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S) and completed in 1908, it was originally a swing-span bridge, and its swing-span section was the longest in the world at the time.  However, 81 years later the main span was converted from a swing-type to a vertical-lift type, in order to widen the navigation channel.  The lift span is one of the highest and longest in the world.  The bridge consists of five sections, with the two sections closest to the bank on each side fixed.

The Harvey Railroad Bridge is a historic structure located east of Harvey, Iowa, United States.  It spans an old channel of the Des Moines River for 600 ft .  The Albia, Knoxville and Des Moines Railroad (AK&D) was planned to traverse the central part of Marion County.  Even though a special tax in the townships the tracks would pass through was approved in 1870, they were unable to complete the line.  The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) acquired the AK&D's assets in 1875 and completed the line.  Initially, the tracks did not cross the Des Moines River where the railroad employed ferries or a temporary bridge.  The CB&Q contracted with the American Bridge Company in 1878 to fabricate the wrought iron Pratt through truss span.  Stone abutments and piers support the bridge.  It is not known whether the CB&Q or AmBridge built the span.  It remained in use as a railroad bridge until 1938 when the county acquired the bridge and the right-of-way for a county road.  The river itself has subsequently been rerouted, and now the bridge crosses a narrow stream.  The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_331", "context": "Jean-Joseph de Mondonville (25 December 1711 (baptised) – 8 October 1772), also known as Jean-Joseph Cassanéa de Mondonville, was a French violinist and composer.  He was a younger contemporary of Jean-Philippe Rameau and enjoyed great success in his day.  Pierre-Louis Daquin (son of the composer Louis-Claude Daquin) claimed: \"If I couldn't be Rameau, there's no one I would rather be than Mondonville\". The musical scores to several operas by the French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau have been lost.  They include two major \"tragédies en musique\", \"Samson\" and \"Linus\", and a one-act pastoral opera \"Lisis et Délie\".  The music to these pieces was substantially complete and was performed in rehearsal but for various reasons - including censorship in the case of \"Samson\" - they were never publicly staged.  Rameau also wrote a \"divertissement\" for Alexis Piron's play \"Les courses de Tempé\", which did appear at the theatre in 1734.  The music to all these works has been almost completely lost, although there is evidence Rameau reused some of it in his later operas.  Rameau also began other operatic projects, which were either abandoned at an early stage (\"Pandore\") or broken up to form shorter works (\"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\"). Lisis et Délie (or Lysis et Délie) was a one-act pastoral opera with music by Jean-Philippe Rameau and a libretto by Jean-François Marmontel.  The musical score is now lost.  It was scheduled to appear at Fontainebleau on 6 November 1753 as part of the celebrations for the birth of the royal prince Xavier, Duke of Aquitaine.  It was due to form a double bill with the \"comédie-ballet\" \"Les hommes\" (words by Germain-François Poullain de Saint-Foix, music by François-Joseph Giraud).  However, it was withdrawn from performance and \"La danse\", the third \"entrée\" of Rameau's \"Les fêtes d'Hébé\", was performed in its place.  The reason given for the work's cancellation was that it was too similar to Rameau's \"Daphnis et Eglé\", premiered at Fontainebleau on 30 October.  The libretto was published but the music does not survive.  Rameau may have reused some of it in his later operas. Louis de Cahusac (6 April 1706 – 22 June 1759) was an 18th-century French playwright and librettist, and Freemason, most famous for his work with the composer Jean-Philippe Rameau.  He provided the libretti for several of Rameau's operas, namely \"Les fêtes de l'Hymen et de l'Amour\" (1747), \"Zaïs\" (1748), \"Naïs\" (1749), \"Zoroastre\" (1749; revised 1756), \"La naissance d'Osiris\" (1754), and \"Anacréon\" (the first of Rameau's operas by that name, 1754).  He is also credited with writing the libretto of Rameau's final work, \"Les Boréades\" (c. 1763).  Cahusac contributed to the Encyclopédie and was the lover of Marie Fel. La naissance d'Osiris, ou La fête Pamilie (\"The Birth of Osiris, or The Festival of Pamylia\") is a one-act opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, first performed on 12 October 1754 at Fontainebleau to celebrate the birth of the future King Louis XVI.  The libretto is by Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac.  Cahusac styled the work a \"ballet allégorique\" (\"allegorical ballet\"), but it is usually categorised as an \"acte de ballet\".  Its slender plot tells of Jupiter's announcement to a group of Egyptian shepherds of the birth of the god Osiris, who symbolises the baby prince.  The piece may have started life as part of a larger work, \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\", an \"opéra-ballet\" Rameau and Cahusac planned but never completed for reasons which are still uncertain. Samson was an opera by the French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau with a libretto by Voltaire.  The work was never staged due to censorship, although Voltaire later printed his text.  Rameau intended the opera on the theme of Samson and Delilah as the successor to his debut \"Hippolyte et Aricie\", which premiered in October 1733.  Like \"Hippolyte\", \"Samson\" was a \"tragédie en musique\" in five acts and a prologue.  Voltaire had become a great admirer of Rameau's music after seeing \"Hippolyte\" and suggested a collaboration with the composer in November 1733.  The opera was complete by late summer 1734 and went into rehearsal.  However, a work on a religious subject with a libretto by such a notorious critic of the Church was bound to run into controversy and \"Samson\" was banned.  An attempt to revive the project in a new version in 1736 also failed.  The score is lost, although Rameau recycled some of the music from \"Samson\" in his later operas. Jean-Philippe Rameau (] ; (1683--)25 1683 – (1764--)12 1764 ) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the Baroque era.  He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside François Couperin. Baroque music ( or ) is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750.  This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era.  Baroque music forms a major portion of the \"classical music\" canon, being nowadays widely studied, performed, and listened to.  Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel. Naïs is an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau first performed on 22 April 1749 at the Opéra in Paris.  It takes the form of a \"pastorale héroïque\" in three acts and a prologue.  The librettist was Louis de Cahusac, in the fourth collaboration between him and Rameau.  The work bears the subtitle \"Opéra pour La Paix\", which refers to the fact that Rameau composed the opera on the occasion of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, at the conclusion of the War of the Austrian Succession.  Its original title was \"Le triomphe de la paix\", but criticism of the terms of the treaty led to a change in the title. Nélée et Myrthis (or Mirthis) is a one-act opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau in the form of an \"acte de ballet\".  Little is known about its background: the score may be incomplete and it was never staged in Rameau's lifetime.  The first known performance took place at the Victoria State Opera, Melbourne, Australia on 22 November 1974.  \"Nélée et Myrthis\" may have been intended to form part of a larger \"opéra-ballet\" to be called \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\".  The name of the librettist is unknown but it was probably Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac.", "com_question": "During which era did Henry Purcell and Jean-Philippe Rameau compose music, and what style characterizes this period?", "com_reference": "Henry Purcell composed music during the Baroque era, which is characterized by its ornate and elaborate style.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_343", "context": "Froudacity: West Indian Fables by James Anthony Froude is an 1889 polemic written by John Jacob Thomas as a rebuttal to James Anthony Froude's 1888 book \"The English in the West Indies\".  Froude's travelogue attacked the British West Indian colonies for wanting to establish self-government, arguing that if the majority black population were allowed to vote on leaders they would choose leaders that would repress the white population.  Like many of his West Indian contemporaries, Thomas was outraged at the inaccuracies of Froude's text as well as the racist arguments that Froude uses as justification for his beliefs.  He decided that writing a refutation to Froude was his patriotic duty and that it would act as self-vindication for West Indian blacks. Percy Hamilton \"Tim\" Tarilton (8 February 1885 – 18 February 1953) was a Barbadian cricketer who represented the West Indies in the days before they achieved Test status.  A good driver of the ball, he made his first-class debut for Barbados in 1905 and played until 1930.  He hit his maiden first-class century against Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.) in 1913.  The First World War prevented Tarilton from establishing an international reputation, for example through touring England.  In 1920, Tarilton scored the first triple-century by a West Indian cricketer, in a match for Barbados against Trinidad when he scored 304 not out.  According to C. L. R. James, Tarilton was the best West Indian batsman before 1923.  George Challenor was a more stylish batsman and greatly admired in Barbados, but Tarilton was the more reliable.  However, Challenor's success on the 1923 tour of England established his reputation.  Tarilton, also chosen to tour, scored 554 runs at an average of 21.30, his only century being 109 not out against Nottinghamshire.  In 1927, he and Challenor scored 292 in an opening partnership against Trinidad, setting a West Indian record for that wicket which lasted until 1950.  His brother Arthur played one first-class match for Jamaica in 1905. Carlos Rigby (June 19, 1945 to May 23, 2017) was a black West Indian poet from Laguna de Perlas on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. Joseph 'Float' Woods (born about 1872 in Barbados, death details unknown) was a coloured West Indian cricketer best known as a member of the 1900 West Indian tourists to England.  He is reckoned to be the first of the coloured West Indian fast bowlers that became a hallmark of West Indian cricket from the 1960s. Tituba of Salem Village is an African-American children's novel by Ann Petry about the 17th-century West Indian slave of the same name who was the first to be accused of practicing witchcraft during the 1692 Salem witch trials.  Written for children 10 and up, it portrays Tituba as a black West Indian woman who tells stories about life in Barbados to the village girls.  These stories are mingled with existing superstitions and half-remembered pagan beliefs on the part of Puritans, and the witchcraft hysteria is partly attributed to a sort of cabin fever during a particularly bitter winter.  Petry's portrayal of the helplessness of women in that period, particularly slaves and indentured servants, is key to understanding her view of the Tituba legend. Richard Cordice Ollivierre (1880 in Kingstown, St. Vincent – 5 June 1937 at New York) was a black West Indian cricketer who toured England in 1906.  He was a right hand batsman, right arm fast bowler and useful wicket-keeper. Cyril Lionel Robert James (4 January 1901 – 31 May 1989), who sometimes wrote under the pen-name J. R. Johnson, was an Afro-Trinidadian historian, journalist and socialist.  His works are influential in various theoretical, social, and historiographical contexts.  His work is a staple of subaltern studies, and he figures as a pioneering and influential voice in postcolonial literature.  A tireless political activist, James's writing on the Communist International stirred debate in Trotskyist circles, and his history of the Haitian Revolution, \"The Black Jacobins\", is a seminal text in the literature of the African Diaspora. Charles Augustus Ollivierre (20 July 1876 – 25 March 1949) was a Vincentian cricketer who represented the West Indies in matches before they attained Test match status.  Born in St Vincent, Ollivierre initially played first-class cricket for Trinidad; he was selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1900.  He later qualified to play first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1901 and 1907, becoming the first black West Indian to play for an English county.  Ollivierre was reasonably successful in county cricket and had a reputation as a stylish batsman.  However, he dropped out of first-class cricket after 1907 owing to eye trouble. Minty Alley is a groundbreaking novel written by Trinidadian writer C. L. R. James in the late 1920s, and published by Secker & Warburg in 1936, as West Indian literature was starting to flourish.  It was the first novel by a black West Indian to be published in England. The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution is a 1938 book by Afro-Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James, a history of the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1804.  He went to Paris to research this work, where he met Haitian military historian Alfred Auguste Nemours.  James's text places the revolution in the context of the French Revolution, and focuses on the leadership of Toussaint L'Ouverture, who was born a slave but rose to prominence espousing the French Revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality.  These ideals, which many French revolutionaries did not maintain consistently with regard to the black humanity of their colonial possessions, were embraced, according to James, with a greater purity by the persecuted blacks of Haiti; such ideals \"meant far more to them than to any Frenchman.\"", "com_question": "Who was the first black West Indian author of a novel in England and what was the novel's title and publication year?", "com_reference": "The first black West Indian author of a novel in England was C.

A tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast aspects of the future state of tropical cyclones.  There are three types of models: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic.  Dynamical models utilize powerful supercomputers with sophisticated mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate future weather conditions.  Statistical models forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner, by extrapolating from historical datasets, and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as personal computers. Statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting.  Four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones: track, intensity, storm surge, and rainfall.  Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem. Philco was one of the pioneers of transistorized computers.

Uzbekistan ( , ), officially the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: \"Oʻzbekiston Respublikasi\" , Ўзбекистон Республикаси , وزبېکىستان رېسپۇبلیکەسی ; Russian: Республика Узбекистан ), is one of only two doubly landlocked countries in the world.  Located in Central Asia, it is a secular, unitary constitutional republic, comprising 12 provinces, one autonomous republic, and a capital city.  Uzbekistan is bordered by five landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Tajikistan to the southeast; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Afghanistan to the south; and Turkmenistan to the southwest. Uzbekistan is a country of Central Asia, located north of Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.  With an area of 447,000 square kilometers (approximately the size of Spain or California), Uzbekistan stretches 1,425 kilometers from west to east and 930 kilometers from north to south.  Bordering Turkmenistan to the southwest, Kazakhstan to the north, and Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to the south and east, Uzbekistan is not only one of the larger Central Asian states but also the only Central Asian state to border all of the other four.  Uzbekistan also shares a short border with Afghanistan to the south.  As the Caspian Sea is an inland sea with no direct link to the oceans, Uzbekistan is one of only two \"doubly landlocked\" countries—countries completely surrounded by other landlocked countries.  The other is Liechtenstein. The Pinal Mountains (Yavapai: Walkame) are a mountain range located in Gila County, Arizona.

The closest city is the Globe, Arizona/Miami, Arizona area, which is just a few miles north of the mountain range.  The mountains are located within the Tonto National Forest, and their recreational facilities are maintained by the USDA's United States Forest Service.  The San Carlos Indian Reservation is very close to the mountain range, with its boundaries being just a few miles east/northeast of the range.  The mountains are covered with Ponderosa Pine and white fir and experience cooler weather than the Globe/Miami area, so that they are a popular recreation area in the summer.  The maintained facilities include a maintained dirt road that goes all the way to the summit of Pinal Peak, a campsite and recreational area, many hiking trails, as well as some radio towers near both Pinal and Signal peaks ( the two highest peaks of the range ).  The mountain range covers an area of 45,760 acres.

Clinical vampirism, more commonly called Renfield's syndrome or Renfield syndrome, is an obsession with drinking blood.  The earliest formal presentation of clinical vampirism to appear in the psychiatric literature, with the psychoanalytic interpretation of two cases, was contributed by Richard L. Vanden Bergh and John F. Kelley in 1964.  As the authors point out, brief and sporadic reports of blood-drinking behaviors associated with sexual pleasure have appeared in the psychiatric literature at least since 1892 with the work of Austrian forensic psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing.  Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry, with the unusual behavior reported as one of many aspects of extraordinary violent crimes.  The behavior has never gained official recognition by the psychiatric profession and is not found in any edition of the \"International Classification of Diseases\" or the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\".  However, in the more colorful era in the history of psychiatry that predated the 1980s rise of the coded categories of (supposedly) theory-neutral mental disorders in \"DSM\" and \"ICD\", the psychiatric literature was fertile ground for the flourishing of case history reports of \"uncommon psychiatric syndromes\" or \"extraordinary disorders of human behavior\" that included not only clinical vampirism, but also lycanthropy, possession, stigmata and other unusual phenomena.", "com_question": "What is Park Dietz's profession?

It is owned 90% by Iberdrola and 10% by IDEA.  It uses 352 parabolic-cylinder collectors, with 120,000 parabolic mirrors and 13,000 absorber tubes. Concentrated solar power (also called concentrating solar power, concentrated solar thermal, and CSP) systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area.  Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator or powers a thermochemical reaction (experimental as of 2013 ).  Heat storage in molten salts allows some solar thermal plants to continue to generate after sunset and adds value to such systems when compared to photovoltaic panels. Aurora Solar Thermal Power Project is a planned solar power tower solar thermal power plant to be located north of Port Augusta in South Australia.  It is planned to generate 150MW of electricity after it is completed in 2020. Alvarado I is a large solar thermal power station in Alvarado, province of Badajoz, in Extremadura, Spain.  Construction on the plant commenced in December 2007 and was completed in July 2009, when commercial operations began.  With an installed capacity of 50 MWe , it is one of the largest solar thermal power stations in the world. The 5 megawatt (MW) Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant in Bakersfield, California is the first commercial solar thermal power plant to be built by Areva Solar.  Completed in 2008, the Kimberlina renewable energy solar boiler uses Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector (CLFR) technology to generate superheated steam.  Each solar boiler has a group of 13 narrow, flat mirrors, that individually track and focus the sun's heat onto overhead pipes carrying water.  The water boils directly into steam.  The steam can then spin a turbine to generate electricity or be used as industrial steam for food, oil and desalination processes.  The Kimberlina solar boiler currently achieves 750-degree F superheated steam.  The next generation solar boiler under construction is designed to achieve 900-degree F superheated steam. Redstone Solar Thermal Power (RSTP) is a planned solar power tower solar thermal power plant, located in Postmasburg, near Kimberley, in the Northern Cape Region of South Africa.

Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi are part of the Garhwal Himalayas, and are located in the state of Uttarakhand.  The graceful peaks of twin mountains are visible from almost everywhere in Kumaon.  The first ascent to the Sunanda Devi peak in recorded history appears to be in 1939 by Jakub Bujak and Janusz Klarner.  The elevation of Sunanda Devi is 7434 m and its prominence is 260 m . Clouds Rest is a mountain in Yosemite National Park east northeast of Yosemite Village, California.  Although there are many peaks in the park having far greater elevation, Clouds Rest's proximity to the valley gives it a very high degree of visual prominence. Momhil Sar, or Mumhail Sar as pronounced in Wakhi is at 7343 m above sea level, is the 64th highest mountain peak in the world.  Mumhail Sar in Wakhi means the mountain that overlooks or is above Grandmother's cattle pen or paddock.

It is the highest point of land located in between the Salt and Gila rivers in Arizona before they merge, making it visible from miles away on a clear day.  The peak ranks as the 11th most prominent in Arizona and has an topographic isolation of 35 mi , with the nearest point of land of equal or greater elevation being to the southeast in the Santa Teresa Mountains.  Pinal Peak is slightly east of the approximate center of the Pinal Mountains.  Despite being the most prominent peak in Gila County, it is not the highest point in the county.  That title goes to Myrtle Point with an elevation between 7963 and(-) , which lies atop the edge of the Mogollon Rim which forms the county line with Coconino County.

Colluvium filled bedrock hollows are the cause of many shallow earth landslides in steep mountainous terrain.  They can form as a U or a V shaped trough as local bedrock variations reveal areas in the bedrock which are more prone to weathering than other locations on the slope.  As the weathered bedrock turns to soil, there is a greater elevation difference between the soil level and the hard bedrock.  With the introduction of water and the thick soil, there is less cohesion and the soil flows out in a landslide.  With every landslide more bedrock is scoured out and the hollow becomes deeper.  After time, colluvium fills the hollow, and the sequence starts again. Disteghil Sar or Distaghil Sar (Urdu: ‎ ) is the highest mountain in the Hispar Muztagh, a subrange of the Karakoram mountain range, in Gilgit-Baltistan.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_370", "context": "K’axob is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization located in Belize.  It was occupied from about 800 B.C. to A.D. 900.  The site is located in northern Belize in the wetlands of Pulltrouser Swamp in proximity to the Sibun River Valley in central Belize.  Research has shown that K’axob was occupied from the Late Preclassic Period to the Early Postclassic Period.  This period in time and the site is characterized by specific ceramic types as well as agriculture and an increase in social stratification.  K’axob is a village site centered on two pyramid plazas and later grew in size during the Early Classic Period to the Late Classic Period.  The site includes a number of household, mounds and plazas.  K’axob is mostly based on residential and household living but also has some ritualistic aspects.  Many of the structures at the site show evidence of household dwellings as well as ritual purposes.  There are many burials at the site that illustrate the ritualistic aspects and social stratification at K’axob.  Many of the individuals, some more than others, were interned with beads made of shell as well as ceramic vessels, demonstrating this potential social stratification.  The pottery vessels recovered from the site demonstrates regularity in the production of pottery.  The most prominent type of ceramic vessels recovered from the site were ‘serving bowls,’ with a tripodal base, and were present during the Early Classic Period.  There is also evidence of specialized areas for pottery production.  There are middens at the site that yielded a great deal of pottery sherds and are associated with structures that are believed to be kilns as well as with tools similar to modern pottery making tools.  There is also some evidence of stone tool production at the site.  The most common stone tool recovered from the site is a chert oval biface and is associated with agriculture and thought to have been used for weeding and hoeing. In the typology of ancient Greek pottery, the kernos (Greek κέρνος or κέρχνος, plural \"kernoi\") is a pottery ring or stone tray to which are attached several small vessels for holding offerings.  Its unusual design is described in literary sources, which also list the ritual ingredients it might contain.  The \"kernos\" was used primarily in the cults of Demeter and Kore, and of Cybele and Attis. Cypriot Bichrome ware is a type of Late Bronze Age, and Iron Age, pottery that is found widely on Cyprus and in the Eastern Mediterranean.  This type of pottery is found in many sites on Cyprus, in the Levant, and also in Egypt.  It was typically produced on a pottery wheel.  A large variety of decorations and motifs are attested.  This pottery is very similar to certain types of the Mycenaean pottery from various locations. Cybele ( ; Phrygian: \"Matar Kubileya/Kubeleya\" \"\"Kubeleyan\" Mother\", perhaps \"\"Mountain\" Mother\"; Lydian \"Kuvava\"; Greek: Κυβέλη \"Kybele\", Κυβήβη \"Kybebe\", Κύβελις \"Kybelis\") is an Anatolian mother goddess; she may have a possible precursor in the earliest neolithic at Çatalhöyük, where statues of obese women, sometimes sitting, have been found in excavations.  She is Phrygia's only known goddess, and was probably its state deity.  Her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor and spread to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies around the 6th century BC. Midianite pottery, also known as “Qurayya ware” is a ware type found in the Hejaz (northwestern Saudi Arabia), southern and central Jordan, southern Israel and the Sinai, generally dated to the 13th-12th centuries BCE, although later dates are also possible.  It was discovered during the 1930s by Nelson Glueck in his surveys in southern Jordan and his excavations at Tell el-Kheleifeh in the southern Arabah valley.  Glueck identified these wares as Iron Age II Edomite pottery.  During his surveys and excavations in the Arabah in the late 1950s and 1960s, Beno Rothenberg found similar decorated wares; and after the discovery at Timna valley of the several Egyptian findings belonging to the 19th and 20th Dynasties, Rothenberg dated this pottery to the 13th-12th centuries BC.  Petrographic studies carried out on some of the Timna wares led to the conclusion that they originated in the Hejaz, most probably in the site of Qurayya.  Midianite bowls bear some resemblance in form with the Iron Age Negevite pottery bowls. Glyn Colledge (1922–2000) was an English designer of pottery.  Colledge began working for the Denby Pottery Company in July 1938, studying at the Burslem School of Art under Gordon Forsyth at the same time.  He served in the RAF Sea Rescue Service during the Second World War.  Afterwards Colledge returned to Denby as a trainee designer, tutored by his father Albert Colledge, who was the design director at the pottery.  He was a part-time student in the ceramics department of Derby College of Art from 1946 to 1956, becoming later a part-time lecturer there and at Ilkeston College of Further Education.  At the pottery Colledge was given the studio formerly used by the Austrian designer Alice Teichtner.  Here he created \"Glyn Ware\", characterised by designs of trailing leaves.  To avoid the high rate of purchase tax on decorative pottery the ware was given functional descriptions, and each piece was signed by Colledge so that it would be classed as studio pottery. Barro negro pottery (\"black clay\") is a style of pottery from Oaxaca, Mexico, distinguished by its color, sheen and unique designs.  Oaxaca is one of few Mexican states which is characterized by the continuance of its ancestral crafts, which are still used in everyday life.  Barro negro is one of several pottery traditions in the state, which also include the glazed green pieces of Santa María Atzompa; however, barro negro is one of the best known and most identified with the state.  It is also one of the most popular and appreciated styles of pottery in Mexico.  The origins of this pottery style extends as far back as the Monte Alban period and for almost all of this pottery's history, had been available only in a grayish matte finish.  In the 1950s, a potter named Doña Rosa devised a way to put a black metallic like sheen onto the pottery by polishing it before firing.  This look has made the pottery far more popular.  From the 1980s to the present, an artisan named Carlomagno Pedro Martínez has promoted items made this way with barro negro sculptures which have been exhibited in a number of countries. To understand past cultures archaeologists analyze many artifacts.  Pottery proves to be of most importance to the archaeological record.  Pottery is durable and even allows its broken fragments to withstand time, which would otherwise decompose other artifacts.  More importantly, the style of pottery often changes through time, and shifts in shape, size, or decoration can be used to resolve the age of the artifact and/or site.  Furthermore, though pottery is common, different cultures had their own distinct styles that can be used to determine its similarities or differences with one another.  Therefore, even fragments of pottery can reconstruct many facets of past cultures. The Point Peninsula Complex was an indigenous culture located in Ontario and New York from 600 BCE to 700 CE (during the Middle Woodland period).  Point Peninsula ceramics were first introduced into Canada around 600 BCE then spread south into parts of New England around 200 BCE.  Some time between 300 BCE and 1 CE, Point Peninsula pottery first appeared in Maine, and \"over the entire Maritime Peninsula.\"  Little evidence exists to show that it was derived from the earlier, thicker pottery, known as Vinette I, Adena Thick, etc.. .  Point Peninsula pottery represented a new kind of technology in North America and has also been called Vinette II.  Compared to existing ceramics that were thicker and less decorated, this new pottery has been characterized by \"superior modeling of the clay with vessels being thinner, better fired and containing finer grit temper.\"  Where this new pottery technology originated is not known for sure.  The origin of this pottery is \"somewhat of a problem.\"  The people are thought to have been influenced by the Hopewell traditions of the Ohio River valley.  This influence seems to have ended about 250 CE, after which they no longer practiced burial ceremonialism.

It features mostly covers of both familiar and obscure 1950s rock and roll songs, along with three original McCartney compositions written in the same style, including the title track.

The song was written no later than spring 1960 and perhaps as early as 1957, and is one of the first Lennon–McCartney compositions.  \"One After 909\" is perhaps more reminiscent of early American rock 'n' roll than any of the other songs from the rooftop show, and as a joke for the rooftop chatter, Lennon sings a variant on the opening line of \"Danny Boy\" after the song is finished. \"I Lie Around\" is a song by Paul McCartney and Wings that was released as the B-side to the \"Live and Let Die\" single in 1973.  The first two verses are sung by Wings guitarist Denny Laine, Paul McCartney sings the third verse. McCartney is the debut studio album by English musician Paul McCartney.  It was issued on Apple Records in April 1970 after McCartney had resisted attempts by his fellow Beatles to have the release delayed to allow for Apple's previously scheduled titles, notably the band's \"Let It Be\" album.  McCartney recorded this solo album during a period of depression and confusion, following John Lennon's private announcement on September 20, 1969 that he was leaving the Beatles, and the conflict over its release further estranged McCartney from his bandmates.

British journalist David Wigg interviewed the individual Beatles at various points from December 1968 or January 1969 to December 1973, and excerpts from some of these recordings constitute the album's spoken words.  Although he was a columnist (\"Young London\") for the London newspaper \"The Evening News\", the interviews were intended for broadcast on BBC Radio 1's \"Scene and Heard\".  Interspersed among the interview excerpts are instrumental performances of Beatles songs, played by other musicians.

Considered one of the best all-round baseballers in Australia, Puckett subsequently represented Western Australia in Claxton Shield competition, having won the award for best player on three consecutive occasions, spanning the 1936, 1937, and 1938 tournaments. The Claxton Shield is an annual competition held by the Australian Baseball Federation.  The 2003 Shield reverted to its original form for the first time since 1988, due to the folding of the International Baseball League of Australia.  The Shield was held in New South Wales at the Blacktown Olympic Park Baseball Stadium between 26 January to 1 February . South Australia (previously known as the South Australian Bite) compete in the Claxton Shield Baseball Championship in Australia.  They were one of the founding teams of the Claxton Shield in 1934 and competed until 1988 where the Claxtion Shield was thereafter awarded to the winner of the Australian Baseball League until 1999 when they were invited to join the International Baseball League of Australia which they competed in for 2 seasons(1999-00 and 2002), after this point the Claxton Shield reverted to a competition similar to 1988. The 2010 Claxton Shield was the 57th Claxton Shield tournament, the premier baseball competition in Australia, and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010.  It was hailed as the precursor to the new Australian Baseball League that will start in the place of the Claxton Shield in late 2010 to early 2011.  The Victoria Aces defeated South Australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament; this was the 22nd time the Claxton Shield had been awarded to a Victorian team.  The competition was sponsored by Domino's Pizza. The Claxton Shield was the name of the premier baseball competition in Australia held between state-based teams, as well as the name of the trophy awarded to the champion team.  From the summer of 1989–90 until 2001–02, and again since 2010–11, the tournament was replaced by one of three other competitions: the original Australian Baseball League (ABL), the International Baseball League of Australia (IBLA), and since the 2010–11 season the new ABL.  Despite other competitions being held in place of the Claxton Shield, the physical trophy has remained the award for the winning teams.  Though city-based teams have competed for the Claxton Shield in some seasons, the name engraved on the shield is that of the winning state; for the 2010–11 ABL season won by the Perth Heat, \"West Australia 2011\" was engraved.", "com_question": "In what country is Hindmarsh Stadium located, and when was the 1934 Claxton Shield held there?", "com_reference": "Hindmarsh Stadium is located in Adelaide, Australia.

It was shot in Vermont and at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.  The film had a troubled production – Clayton fell out with Bradbury over an uncredited script rewrite, and after test screenings of the director's cut failed to meet the studio's expectations, Disney sidelined Clayton, fired the original editor, and scrapped the original score, spending some $5 million and many months re-shooting, re-editing and re-scoring the film, before its eventual release.

Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v.

California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body.  Until \"Schmerber\", the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects.  Likewise, the Court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect in the course of a criminal prosecution. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that criminal suspects have a right to counsel during police interrogations under the Sixth Amendment.  The case was decided a year after the court held in \"Gideon v. Wainwright\", 372 U.S. 335 (1963) that indigent criminal defendants had a right to be provided counsel at trial. Stephen P. Halbrook is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and an author and lawyer known for his litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association.  He has written extensively about the original meanings of the Second Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment (the latter as applied to Second Amendment rights).  He has argued and won three cases before the US Supreme Court: \"Printz v. United States\", \"United States v. Thompson-Center Arms Company\", and \"Castillo v. United States\".  He has also written briefs in many other cases, including the Supreme Court cases \"Small v. United States\" (pertaining to the Gun Control Act of 1968) and \"McDonald v. Chicago\".  In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", he wrote a brief on behalf of the majority of both houses of Congress.  More broadly, his decades of research on the Second Amendment contributed to the intellectual foundation of the \"Heller\" decision.  He has written many books and articles on the topic of gun control, some of which have been cited in Supreme Court opinions (\"Heller\", \"McDonald\", \"Printz v. United States\").  He has testified before congress on multiple occasions.  Halbrook’s most important scholarly contribution, however, was the book \"That Every Man Be Armed\", originally published in 1986.  The book was the most thorough analysis of the legal history and original intent of the Second Amendment. Glossip v.

Westendorp v R, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 43 was a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the scope of the federal Parliament's criminal law power under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867.  A unanimous Court found that a municipal by-law that prohibited standing in the street for the purpose of prostitution was in the nature of a criminal law prohibition and therefore ultra vires of the provincial constitutional authority.  The decision surprised many legal scholars who considered it to be inconsistent with previous Supreme Court cases where provincial laws of a moral nature were upheld under the provincial power (see \"Canada (AG) v Montreal (City of)\", [1978] and \"Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v McNeil\" [1978]).  This was also the first case where the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" was cited in argument to the Supreme Court, although the Charter argument was ultimately abandoned during the hearing. Danny Escobedo (born c. 1937) was a Chicago petitioner in the Supreme Court case of \"Escobedo v. Illinois\", which established a criminal suspect's right to remain silent and have an attorney present during questioning.  This case was an important precedent to the famous \"Miranda v. Arizona\" decision. Evans v. Jordan, 13 U.S. 199 (1815) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that someone who had copied a patented invention after the patent had expired, and before the patent was restored by a private bill, would be liable for damages for patent infringement for any use continuing after the patent was restored.  It was the second published Supreme Court decision on patent law, and the first of four Supreme Court cases dealing with the Oliver Evans flour mill patent.  Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to \"Evans v. Eaton\", however, this case did not deal with substantive patent law, but only with issues of statutory construction and infringement liability. R v Sinclair 2010 35 is a leading case from the Supreme Court of Canada on a detainee's right to counsel under section 10(b) of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Specifically, the case addresses two issues regarding the police's implementation duty under the right to counsel: 1) does a detainee have the right to have a lawyer present during police questioning, and 2) does a detainee have the right to make multiple phone calls to their lawyer.  A majority of the Court answered the first question in the negative, and answered the second question in the negative, subject to a change of circumstances.  The parties to the case were the appellant, Sinclair, the respondent, the Attorney General of British Columbia, and the following interveners: the Attorney General of Ontario, the Director of Public Prosecutions of Canada, the Criminal Lawyers' Association of Ontario, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

It has been a strong supporter of Irish unionism and has had close links with the Ulster Unionist Party, which governed Northern Ireland from 1922 to 1972.  The Institution has lodges throughout Ireland, although it is strongest in the North.  There are also branches throughout the British Commonwealth (especially in Scotland and Canada), and in the United States.  In the 20th century, the Institution went into sharp decline outside Northern Ireland and County Donegal.  Observers have accused the Orange Institution of being a sectarian organisation, due to its goals and its exclusion of Roman Catholics and close relatives of Catholics as members.  The Order has a substantial fraternal and benevolent component. Colonel William Willoughby Cole Verner (22 October 1852 – 25 January 1922) was a British soldier, writer and ornithologist and inventor of a type of compass.  He was briefly a Professor of Topography at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

The Loyal Orange Institution, more commonly known as the Orange Order, is a Protestant fraternal organisation based primarily in Northern Ireland.  It also has a significant presence in the Scottish Lowlands and lodges throughout the Commonwealth, as well as in the United States and Togo.  The Orange Order was founded in County Armagh in 1795, during a period of Protestant–Catholic sectarian conflict, as a Masonic-style brotherhood sworn to maintain the Protestant Ascendancy.  It is headed by the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, which was established in 1798.  Its name is a tribute to the Dutch-born Protestant king William of Orange, who defeated the army of Catholic king James II in the Williamite–Jacobite War (16881691).  Its members wear orange sashes and are referred to as Orangemen.  The Order is best known for its yearly marches, the biggest of which are held on or around 12 July ('The Twelfth'). Provincial Grand Master (abbreviated PGM or PrGM), sometimes called District Grand Master or Metropolitan Grand Master, is a fraternal office held by the head of a Provincial Grand Lodge, who is directly appointed by the organisation's Grand Master.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_392", "context": "A definitive stamp is a postage stamp that is part of the regular issue of a country's stamps, available for sale by the post office for an extended period of time and designed to serve the everyday postal needs of the country.  The term is used in contrast to a \"provisional stamp\", one that is issued for a temporary period until regular stamps are available, or a \"commemorative stamp\", a stamp \"issued to honor a person or mark a special event\" available only for a limited time.  Commonly, a definitive issue or series includes stamps in a range of denominations sufficient to cover current postal rates.  An \"issue\" generally means a set that is put on sale all at the same time, while a \"series\" is spread out over several years, but the terms are not precise.  Additional stamps in a series may be produced as needed by changes in postal rates but some values may be permanently available, regardless of prevailing rates, for instance 1c or 1p and $1 or £1. The New York Postmaster's Provisional is, as its designation implies, a postage stamp provided by the New York Post Office to facilitate the prepayment of mail at a time when the United States had not yet issued postage stamps for national use.  Placed on sale on July 14, 1845, this was the nation’s first provisional stamp to be issued by a local post office in response to the congressional postal reform act that had taken effect two weeks earlier.  That law, passed on March 3, 1845, standardized nationwide mail rates, with the result that the use of stamps became a practical and reliable method of postal prepayment.  (Before standardization, the many different postal rates in different jurisdictions had made fees too unpredictable to prepay all letters with stamps as a matter of course, with the result that recipients of letters--rather than senders--generally paid the postage on them.)  Baltimore announced the issue of a provisional stamp one day after New York, on July 15, and New Haven soon followed.  The New York issue has been cited as \"the most elegantly executed and widely used of the group of provisionals issued by eleven different [U. S. post] offices between 1845 and 1847.\" The Sachsen 3 Pfennige red, commonly called \"Sachsendreier\", issued on 29 June 1850 and valid from 1 July 1850 until 31 December 1867, was the first postage stamp of the Kingdom of Saxony, making this country the second among the German States (after the Kingdom of Bavaria) to issue postage stamps. The stamp program of a postal organization is an umbrella term for the entire process of postage stamp issuance and distribution by the organization.  Aspects include the decision of about stamps to issue, what postal rates they will pay, postage stamp design, printing, and publicity for the new stamps.  The stamp program is generally managed by a specialized department within the organization, which balances demands from the rest of the organization, the nation's government, stamp collectors, and the public which actually buy and use the stamps. The Liberty issue was a definitive series of postage stamps issued by the United States between 1954 and 1965.  It offered twenty-four denominations, ranging from a half-cent issue showing Benjamin Franklin to a five dollar issue depicting Alexander Hamilton.  However, in a notable departure from all definitive series since 1870, the stamp for a normal first-class letter—the 3-cent value—did not present the portrait of a president, but instead offered a monocolor .  Moreover, two-color renderings of the Statue of Liberty appeared on both the 8 cent and 11 cent stamps; and it is from these three denominations that the Liberty issue takes its name.  (Oversized versions of the 3c and 8c stamps also appeared on a Miniature sheet issued in 1956 for the Fifth International Philatelic exhibition.)  Pictures of other national landmarks, such as Bunker Hill and Mount Vernon, are found on several values, while the rest of the stamps follow tradition, containing portraits of well-known historic Americans.  The six denominations in the set that illustrate buildings (The Alamo, Monticello, etc.) were all designed in landscape format, resulting in a free intermixture of landscape and portrait orientation for the first time in a definitive U. S. issue (in all previous mixed sets, landscape stamps had been confined to the highest denominations). The Pagsanjan Falls stamp is a postage stamp, issued on 3 May 1932, which is notable for having an error.  It is part of a set of seven stamps showing places of interest and landmarks in the Philippines, at that time a United States territory.  It is a postage stamp design error printed in the United States and intended to display an image of Pagsanjan Falls, a tourist attraction in Laguna province in the Philippines.  However, the image on the stamp is actually of Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park, California. A first day of issue cover or first day cover (FDC) is a postage stamp on a cover, postal card or stamped envelope franked on the first day the issue is authorized for use within the country or territory of the stamp-issuing authority.  Sometimes the issue is made from a temporary or permanent foreign or overseas office.  There will usually be a first day of issue postmark, frequently a pictorial cancellation, indicating the city and date where the item was first issued, and \"first day of issue\" is often used to refer to this postmark.  Depending on the policy of the nation issuing the stamp, official first day postmarks may sometimes be applied to covers weeks or months after the date indicated. Postage stamp paper is the foundation or substrate of the postage stamp to which the ink for the stamp's design is applied to one side and the adhesive is applied to the other.  The paper is not only the foundation of the stamp but it has also been incorporated into the stamp's design, has provided security against fraud and has aided in the automation of the postal delivery system. A postage stamp design error is a mistake made during the design phase of the postage stamp production process.  Design errors most commonly occur as minor mistakes, such as a missing letter in the binomial name of an organism depicted on the stamp, but some have been major gaffes, such as a map appearing to lay claim to another country's territory, or the depiction of the wrong person on the stamp. Verigar was the first postage stamp series of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, issued in Slovenia after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy at the end of World War I.  The name of the stamp series is derived from the Slovene word \"veriga\", meaning 'chain', and depicts a slave who has broken the chains.  The scene symbolizes the freedom of the Slavic peoples from Austria-Hungary.  It was designed by the academic painter Ivan Vavpotič, whose model was the gymnast Stane Derganc.", "com_question": "What national landmark is depicted on the Liberty issue stamp series?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_393", "context": "Jerome A. Stone is an American author, philosopher, and theologian.  He is best known for helping to develop the religious movement of Religious Naturalism.  Stone is on the Adjunct Faculty of Meadville Lombard Theological School; is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at William Rainey Harper College; is in Preliminary Fellowship with the Unitarian Universalist Association; and is a member of the Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought (HIARPT) and the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science (IRAS). Marshall Keeble (December 7, 1878 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee – April 20, 1968 in Nashville, Tennessee) was an African American preacher of the Churches of Christ, whose successful career notably bridged a racial divide in an important American religious movement prior to the Civil Rights Movement.  Keeble enjoyed an almost unrivalled position as an African-American subject of hagiographical biography by white contemporaries within the church of which Keeble was a member.  A notable example of this is \"Roll Jordan Roll\" by fellow minister and longtime Keeble associate, J. E. Choate. William Miller Chapel and Ascension Rock is a historic district in New York that encompasses the home of William Miller, who was a Baptist preacher, from the United States, credited with beginning the mid-nineteenth century North American religious movement that was known as the Millerites.  After his prophetic interpretations did not happen as he expected, new heirs of his message emerged, including Seventh-day Adventists and Advent Christians.  Later movements found inspiration in Miller's emphasis on Bible prophecy. Jarena Lee (February 11, 1783 – 1864) was a 19th-century African-American woman who left behind an eloquent account of her religious experience.  The publishing of her autobiography made Lee the first African American woman to have an autobiography published in the United States.  She was also the first woman authorized to preach by Richard Allen, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, in 1819.  Despite Allen's blessing, Lee continued to face hostility to her ministry because she was black and a woman.  She became a traveling minister, traveling thousands of miles on foot.  In one year alone, she \"travelled two thousand three hundred and twenty-five miles, and preached one hundred and seventy-eight sermons.\"  Lee’s importance is threefold.  First, she exemplifies the 19th-century American religious movement’s focus on personal holiness and sanctification.  Second, she left a detailed account of her life of faith that serves as a valuable primary source.  Third, she became an eloquent witness to her faith and a pioneer for women seeking license to preach in the Methodist traditions. William Miller (February 15, 1782 – December 20, 1849), an American Baptist preacher, is credited with beginning the mid-19th century North American religious movement known as the Millerites.  After his prophecies of the Second Coming did not occur as expected in the 1840s, new heirs of his message emerged, including the Advent Christians (1860) and the Seventh-day Adventists (1863).  Later movements found inspiration in Miller's emphasis on Bible prophecy; the Bahá'í Faith holds that his predictions of 1844 events were accurate. Clorinda S. Minor (1806–1855) was an American woman from Philadelphia who became influenced by William Miller.  When his prophecy failed to materialize she decided to set sail for Palestine.  She first traveled to Palestine in May 1849 and came to support the experimental farm set up by the Finn family at Artas.  In November 1851 she set off for Palestine again and settled on the outskirts of Jaffa at a place known as Mount Hope. Qasim Pasha al-Ahmad (died 1834) was the chief of the Jamma'in subdistrict of Jabal Nablus during the Ottoman and Egyptian periods in Palestine in the mid-19th century.  He also served as the \"mutassalim\" (tax collector) of Jerusalem between 1832 and 1833.  Qasim headed the Qasim clan, a prominent rural family of Jabal Nablus.  He led the peasants of Palestine in their revolt against the Egyptian rule of Ibrahim Pasha in 1834.  Following the revolt's suppression, he was captured and executed by the authorities. John D. McIver Farm is a historic home and farm located near Sanford, Lee County, North Carolina.  The farmhouse was built about 1855, and is a two-story, weatherboarded, mortise-and-tenon frame I-house with Greek Revival style design elements.  It sits on a brick and brownstone foundation, has exterior gable-end brick chimneys, an integral one-story-ell, and later additions.  Also on the property are the contributing meat house (c. 1855), well no. 1 (c. 1855), wooden gate posts and fence (mid-19th century), and corn crib (mid-19th century). Terri Lee Hoffman (March 21, 1938 – October 31, 2015), later known as Terri Lilya Keanely, was an American religious cult leader known for the mysterious deaths of her followers, including two husbands, shortly after they had willed their possessions to her.  The devotees in her Dallas-based new religious movement, Conscious Development of Body, Mind and Soul, fought against the \"black lords\" on various planes of existence and protected themselves with powerful gems.  The goal was joining God and the twelve \"masters\" through reincarnation in the spiritual realm.  A four-year investigation by Dallas district attorney's office failed to produce evidence tying Hoffman to the deaths, but she was later sentenced to prison for bankruptcy fraud. Asbury Grove, located in Hamilton, Massachusetts, was formed during the camp meeting religious movement popular in the mid-19th century.  Originally set on seventy-five acres of land, the camp was founded by the Methodist church in 1857.  Ten of the original seventy-five acres were purchased from Joseph Dodge, a local farmer.  This land included a farmhouse, which later became the Superintendent's Cottage.", "com_question": "What movement did Clorinda S. Minor belong to? When did she travel to Palestine?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_394", "context": "New England (Latin: \"Nova Anglia\" ) was a colony allegedly founded in the late 11th century by English refugees fleeing William the Conqueror.  Its existence is only attested in two sources, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, the French \"Chronicon Universale Anonymi Laudunensis\" and the Icelandic \"Játvarðar Saga\".  They tell the story of a journey from England through the Mediterranean Sea that led to Constantinople, where the English refugees fought off a siege by heathens and were rewarded by the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus.  A group of them were given land to the north-east of the Black Sea, reconquering it and renaming their territory \"New England\".  Though these sources are late, New England is thought by some historians to be based on a reality. Laurentius saga (modern Icelandic \"Lárentíus saga\") is an Icelandic Saga, written in the third quarter of the fourteenth century, describing the life of Icelandic bishop Laurentius Kálfsson, thus covering the period 1267–1331.  The presumed author, Einarr Hafliðason, was a student and friend of Laurentius.  Although incomplete, \"Laurentius saga\" is considered to be one of the best written of the early Icelandic biographies, as well as being an important source of information about the teaching and education methods of the day.  It can be seen as one of the products of the North Icelandic Benedictine School. Thómas saga Erkibyskups (English: Saga of Archbishop Thomas ) is an Icelandic saga on Saint Thomas Becket written in the 14th century and based on earlier sources: a now lost \"Life\" by Robert of Cricklade which was written soon after Becket's murder, a \"Life\" by Benet of St Albans, and an Icelandic translation of the \"Quadrilogus\" (a composite life based on 12th-century biographers).  It provides some unique details, like Thomas speaking with a stammer; these details mostly come from Robert's \"Life\", which also was a source for Benet's. The Játvarðar Saga (in full Saga Játvarðar konungs hins helga), is an Icelandic saga about the life of Edward the Confessor, King of England (1042–1066).  It was compiled in the 14th century, in Iceland, using a number of earlier English sources as well as the French \"Chronicon Universale Anonymi Laudunensis\" (or a source common with it).  It was translated into English in 1894 by G. W. Dasent.  Among the various details contained in the saga, there is an account of the origin of an English colony in the Black Sea founded by one \"Siward earl of Gloucester\" (\"Sigurðr jarl af Glocestr\"), a refugee of the Norman Conquest of England. Nitida saga (medieval manuscript spelling) or Nítíða saga (normalised Old Norse and modern Icelandic spelling) is a fictional late medieval Icelandic romance saga thought to have been composed in Iceland in the fourteenth century.  This saga is about a maiden-king named Nitida, who rules over France, and who is pursued by kings and princes from such faraway places as Constantinople, India, and a place the saga calls the Land of the Saracens.  It is thought to be a direct response to \"Klári saga\": in \"Klári saga\", the main female protagonist, Serena, is brutally punished for her initial refusal to marry the hero Klárus, whereas the heroine of \"Nitida saga\" is portrayed much more favourably.  Ethnicity, travel, and geography play important roles in the saga, and questions of gender and power, while magic, trickery, and deception are also prominent. Egil's Saga or Egill's saga (Old Norse: Egils saga ;    ) is an Icelandic saga (family saga) on the lives of the clan of Egill Skallagrímsson (Anglicised as Egil Skallagrimsson), an Icelandic farmer, viking and skald.  The saga spans the years c. 850–1000 and traces the family history from Egil's grandfather to his offspring. Þjalar-Jóns saga ('the saga of Þjálar-Jón' or 'Jón of the file'), also known as \"Saga Jóns Svipdagssonar ok Eireks forvitna\" ('the saga of Jón Svipdagsson and Eirekur the Curious') is a medieval Icelandic saga defined variously as a romance-saga and a legendary saga.  The earliest manuscript, Holm.  perg.  6 4to, dates from around the first quarter of the fifteenth century, and the saga is thought to be from the fourteenth century. Njáls saga (    ) (also Njála (   ), Brennu-Njáls saga (   ) or \"The Story of Burnt Njáll\") is a thirteenth-century Icelandic saga that describes events between 960 and 1020.  The principal characters are the friends Njáll Þorgeirsson, a lawyer and a sage, and Gunnar Hámundarson, a formidable warrior.  Gunnar's wife instigates a feud that leads to the death of many characters over several decades including the killing by fire of the eponymous \"Burnt Njáll\".  The saga deals with this process of blood feuds in the Icelandic Commonwealth, showing how the requirements of honor could lead to minor slights spiralling into destructive and prolonged bloodshed.  Insults where a character's manhood is called into question are especially prominent and may reflect an author critical of an overly restrictive ideal of masculinity.  Another characteristic of the narrative is the presence of omens and prophetic dreams.  It is disputed whether this reflects a fatalistic outlook on the part of the author. The Jómsvíkinga saga (Saga of the Jomsvikings) is a medieval Icelandic saga composed by an anonymous Icelander.  The Saga was composed in Iceland during the 13th century.  It exists in several manuscripts which vary from each other.  There are many different versions and translations of the saga. Olaf the Peacock (Old Norse: Ólafr Pái) or Olaf Hoskuldsson (Ólafr Höskuldsson) (c. 938–1006) was a merchant and chieftain of the early Icelandic Commonwealth, who was nicknamed \"the Peacock\" because of his proud bearing and magnificent wardrobe.  He is a major character in the \"Laxdæla saga\" and is mentioned in a number of other Icelandic sources.  The son of a slave woman, Olaf became one of the wealthiest landowners in Iceland and played a major role in its politics and society during the latter half of the tenth century.  In addition to the \"Laxdæla Saga\" in which he takes a leading role, Olaf also is mentioned in \"Egils saga\", \"Njáls saga\", \"Gunnlaugs saga\", \"Kormáks saga\", \"Grettirs saga\" and the \"Landnámabók\", among others.", "com_question": "In which century was New England founded, who rewarded the refugees, and where did they settle?", "com_reference": "Based on the passage, New England was allegedly founded in the late 11th century by English refugees fleeing William the Conqueror.

The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey's name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans).  Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century.  The use of the term \"bourbon\" for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s.

Anyone is the brainchild of Riz Story, the band's lead singer, guitarist, songwriter and producer, and also the only member of the band that has remained since its inception.  Former members include Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters, Alanis Morissette), Jon Davidson (YES, Sky Cries Mary) and David Silveria (Korn). This is a list of Viking metal bands.  Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music with origins in black metal and Nordic folk music, characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age.  Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than genre, but it is typically manifested as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music.  Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both clean and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Post-metal (or metalgaze) is a stylistic fusion of heavy metal with post-rock or shoegazing.  Hydra Head Records owner and Isis frontman Aaron Turner originally termed the genre \"thinking man's metal\", demonstrating that his band was trying to move away from common metal conventions.  Due to the experimental nature of post-rock and shoegazing, post-metal is closely related to avant-garde metal. Loudness (ラウドネス , Raudonesu ) is a Japanese heavy metal band formed in 1981 by guitarist Akira Takasaki and drummer Munetaka Higuchi.  They were the first Japanese metal act signed to a major label in the United States, releasing twenty-six studio albums (five in America) and nine live albums by 2014 and reaching the \"Billboard\" Top 100 in their moment of maximum international popularity, as well as charting on Oricon dozens of times.  Despite numerous changes in their roster, with Takasaki the sole constant member, the band continued their activities throughout the 1990s, finally reuniting the original line-up in 2001.  This incarnation released a further seven albums until November 30, 2008, when original drummer Munetaka Higuchi died from liver cancer at a hospital in Osaka at age 49.  He was replaced with Masayuki Suzuki. Halley was opened in 1985, and it was initially a common nightclub.  As both the manager Roberto Ricci and the DJ Jorge Peso liked heavy metal, they included some heavy metal songs.  Mario Ian, singer of Alakran, proposed to make a concert in Halley; which was a huge success.  There were few music venues for Argentine heavy metal bands at the time, so Ricci and the owner Alberto Corapi thought it would be profitable to turn the nightclub into a music hall. Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age.  Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music.  Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Phantom Blue is the self-titled first studio album by all-female heavy metal band Phantom Blue, released in 1989 through Shrapnel Records (United States) and Roadrunner Records (Europe and Japan).  Guitarist Marty Friedman, at the time a member of the band Cacophony, and later of Megadeth, is credited as a co-producer.  According to drummer Linda McDonald, the music video for \"Why Call It Love?\"  was filmed within a maximum security prison in Carson City, Nevada. Balkandji is a folk metal band from Bulgaria.  They freely mix traditional Bulgarian music with hard rock and heavy metal.  As Bulgarian folk music is very complex, in Balkandji songs odd time signatures and constant time signature changing are very common.  They create a characteristic blend of melodies taken from the Bulgarian folklore with heavy guitars riffs. Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal.  It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal.  The genre emerged in the late-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century.  In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. \"Open\" is a song by the American heavy metal band Queensrÿche.  It was released as a single in support of their 2003 album \"Tribe\".  This song was featured on the PC port of the 2003 Video Game, .", "com_question": "What year did Anyone form?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_399", "context": "\"Childe Rowland\" is a fairy tale, the most popular version written by Joseph Jacobs in his \"English Fairy Tales\", published in 1890.  It was based on a Scottish ballad, which is why the text alternates between prose and rhyming stanzas.  Joseph Jacobs called the King of Elfland's palace \"the Dark Tower\" in his version, an addition he made that was not part of the original ballad.  This harks to Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" and Robert Browning's poem \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,\" but neither of those references have any relation to the fairy tale. Stan Bolovan is a Romanian fairy tale collected in \"Rumänische Märchen\" by Mite Kremnitz (1882).  Fairy tale collector Andrew Lang included it in his \"The Violet Fairy Book\" (1901).  Versions of the tale were later retold by Ruth Manning-Sanders in \"A Book of Dragons\" (1965) and \"A Choice of Magic\" (1971), and by Christopher Rawson in \"The Usborne Book of Dragons\" (1979). \"The Fisherman and His Wife\" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale no. 19.  It is Aarne–Thompson type 555, the fisherman and his wife.  Its theme was used in \"The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish\", an 1833 poem by Aleksandr Pushkin.  Virginia Woolf has her character Mrs. Ramsey in \"To the Lighthouse\" read a version of the story to her son, James.  Günter Grass's 1977 novel, \"The Flounder,\" is loosely based on the fairy tale, as are Emanuele Luzzati's version, \"Punch and the Magic Fish,\" and Ursula LeGuin's novel \"The Lathe of Heaven\". New Fairy Tales (Danish: \"Nye Eventyr\" ) is a collection of four fairy tales written by Hans Christian Andersen and published by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 10 November 1843.  As was customary at the time however, the title page is dated 1844.  The tales are completely Andersen's invention, owe no debt to folk or fairy lore, and are the most autobiographical of his several fairy tale collections.  The collection was received enthusiastically by the Danish critics and public and became Andersen's break-through in the fairy tale genre.  \"The Nightingale\" and \"The Ugly Duckling\" have been adapted to various forms of drama. Bonner Bolton (born June 1, 1987 in Odessa, Texas) is a Championship Bull Riding (CBR) 2007 World Champion professional bull rider and fashion model.  Bolton competed in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS), the elite tour of the organization.  He placed fourth in the PBR World Finals in 2015.  He performed as a stunt double for Scott Eastwood in the movie, The Longest Ride, being the only one of four doubles who managed to make a virtually 8 second ride on the PBR top ranked bull Rango for an ending scene.  His bull riding career was cut short by a neck injury sustained during a dismount from a bull he had just finished making an 8-second ride on at a PBR BFTS event in January 2016.  He sustained a break to his C-2 vetebra.  Bolton was temporarily paralyzed, but made a full recovery.  The parent company, IMG, of the PBR made an offer to contract him as a fashion model in May 2016.  Bolton now works steadily as a fashion model. The Buried Moon or The Dead Moon is a fairy tale included by Joseph Jacobs in \"More English Fairy Tales\".  It is a striking unusual tale, with few variants, and often appearing more mythological than is common for fairy tales.  It was collected by Mrs. Balfour from the North Lincolnshire Carrs in the Ancholme Valley; its unusual characteristics made many people doubt its origins as a fairy tale.  However, when Mrs. Balfour published her notes, they were generally found reliable, and the Fens proved to have many other unusual legends.  The story may be evidence of moon worship. Kashchey the Deathless (Russian: Кащей бессмертный , \"Kashchey bessmertnïy\"), Kashchey the Immortal, is a one-act opera in three scenes (styled a \"little autumnal fairy tale\") by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  The libretto was written by the composer, and is based on a Russian fairy tale about Koschei the Deathless, an evil, ugly old wizard, who menaced principally young women.  A similar fairy tale was also used by Igor Stravinsky (Rimsky-Korsakov's pupil) and Michel Fokine to create their iconic ballet, \"The Firebird\". \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" (Danish: \"Den standhaftige tinsoldat\") is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a tin soldier's love for a paper ballerina.  After several adventures, the tin soldier perishes in a fire with the ballerina.  The tale was first published in Copenhagen by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children.  New Collection.\"  The booklet consists of Andersen's \"The Daisy\" and \"The Wild Swans\".  The tale was Andersen’s first not based upon a folk tale or a literary model.  \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated film. The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish (Russian: Сказка о рыбаке и рыбке , \"Skazka o rybake i rybke\") is a fairy tale in verse by Alexander Pushkin.  Pushkin wrote the tale in autumn 1833 and it was first published in the literary magazine \"Biblioteka dlya chteniya\" in May 1835.  The tale is about a fisherman who manages to catch a \"Golden Fish\" which promises to fulfill any wish of his in exchange for its freedom.  The storyline is similar to the Russian fairy tale \"The Greedy Old Wife\" (according to Vladimir Propp) and the Brothers Grimm's tale \"The Fisherman and His Wife\". The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples (\"Zlatna jabuka i devet paunica\") is a Serbian epic poetry.  It was published for the first time as a fairy tale by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in 1853.  Later on it was published as a Bulgarian fairy tale by A. H. Wratislaw in his \"Sixty Folk-Tales from Exclusively Slavonic Sources\", number 38 in 1890.  Andrew Lang included it in \"The Violet Fairy Book\", as a translation from a German version of Karadžić's original tale.  Ruth Manning-Sanders included it in \"\".

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_403", "context": "A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film.  The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question.  Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians – most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists – and recorded by a sound engineer.

Alexandre Hébert (4 March 1921, Alvimare, Seine-Maritime - 16 January 2010), was a French activist, anarchist and trade unionist.  He had a pivotal role in the accession of anarchists to the French trade-unions congress Workers' Force (CGT-FO).  He became secretary of the departmental union of \"Loire Atlantique\", from its inception, as well as Raymond Patoux, secretary of the departmental union of \"Maine et Loire\", as shown by the research \"Libertaires et syndicalistes révolutionnaires dans la Confédération Générale du Travail - Force Ouvrière (1946-1957)\" by Guillaume Trousset, and\"L'Union Départementale CGT-Force ouvrière de Maine et Loire de 1948 à 195\" by Manuella Noyer.  He played an important role in the accession to these unions of militants of the autonomous \"Fédération de l'Education Nationale\" in 1982, 1983 and 1984.  Its activities of militant trade unionism had been permanently in the style set out by Fernand Pelloutier in the letter to his anarchist friends \"Lettre aux anarchistes\" in 1899.  He didn't cease to fight against all the followers (official and unofficial) of trade unionism who were subservient to political parties, Christian trade unionism, autonomous trade unionism, partisan trade unionism, and all varieties of company sponsored or integrated trade unionism; he could never get along with the followers of all these sorts of trade unionism!  A fighter for workers' emancipation in all circumstances, he did not hesitate to separate himself from some of his anarchist fellows who took another way, including that of joining the varieties of Christian trade unionism.  As a militant anarchist, he was of those who reconstructed the anarchist movement after the second world war, through the \"Fédération anarchiste\"; in 1954, he was one of those who reconstructed the \"Fédération anarchist\" destroyed by the Leninist action of Georges Fontenis; in 1961, he contributed with his followers of the \"Groupe Fernand Pelloutier\" to the publication of the news bulletin L'Anarcho-syndicaliste, prelude to the constitution of the Union des anarcho-syndicalistes.  Not having any sectarianism, he tried at all times to gather together the activist workers anxious to preserve the independence of trade unions; a friend of Pierre Boussel alias Pierre Lambert, he certainly helped the abandonment by the members of his Trotskyist party of the Marxist–Leninist-Trotskyist idea of the need to link the unions to the “revolutionary party”.  Free-thinker, secular activist, and rationalist, he took part in the initiative of the l'Appel aux laïque against the policy concerning the public schools and the institutions of the Republic followed by the President of the Republic François Mitterrand.

The Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis was a Roman law promulgated by the Roman Consul Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC.  It was one of three laws introduced by the Romans during the Social War (91–88 BC) between Rome and her Socii (allies), where some of Rome's Italic allies rebelled and waged war against her because of her refusal to grant them Roman citizenship.  This law dealt with the local communities in Transpadana, the region north of the River Po, (and possibly some Ligurian communities south of this river, along its western course).  It granted Latin Rights (\"ius Latii\") to these peoples as a reward for siding with the Rome during the Social War.  This gave the inhabitants of the region the legal benefits associated with these rights, which were previously restricted to the towns of Latium (land of the Latins) which had not been incorporated into the Roman Republic and to the citizens of Latin colonies.  They included: A) \"Ius Commercii\" (right to trade), \"a privilege granted to Latin colonies to have contractual relations, to trade with Roman citizens on equal terms and to use the form of contracts available to Roman citizens\".  It also allowed contracts and trade on equal terms with citizens of another Latin towns.  B) \"Ius Connubii\" (right to marry), was the right to conclude a marriage recognised by law, \"ius connubii\" of both parties was necessary for the validity of the marriage.  Later it was extended to citizens of foreign communities \"either generally, or by special concession\".  In the case of Latin rights it made marriages between citizens of different Latin towns legal.  C) \"Ius migrationis\" (right to migrate), the right to retain one’s level of citizenship if the individual relocated to another city.  In other words, it facilitated migration by the acquisition of citizenship of another Latin town.  In addition to this, the law granted Roman citizenship to the magistrates (officials) of the local towns.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_405", "context": "Rosella Sensi (born 18 December 1971 in Rome) is an entrepreneur and Italian professional sports executive.  She was the chairperson of the Italian professional football (soccer) club Associazione Sportiva Roma (A.S. Roma, usually referred to simply as Roma) from 2008 to 2011. Associazione Sportiva Roma had a rather average season, but finished solidly inside the top half of Serie A with a sixth place.  German striker Rudi Völler had his best season at Roma, scoring 14 league goals, whilst Stefano Desideri hit 10 goals.  The greatest success of Roma's season was the Primavera team winning the national championship. Associazione Sportiva Roma did not repeat its Coppa Italia victory from the previous season, but retained its status as the top team from the Capital with fifth in the league standings.  Roma's main struggle was its inability to seal matches by a close margin, drawing on 14 occasions, and it neither had a watertight defence, nor a fearsome attack.  Despite those shortcomings, Roma was only three points behind Torino for third. Associazione Sportiva Roma was reinvigorated under new coach Zdeněk Zeman, who recently had been coaching arch rivals Lazio.  Zeman brought his attacking 4–3–3 with him, resulting in Roma scoring 67 goals, but also conceding 42, an extreme rarity in defensive-minded Italian football.  Roma finished fourth, three places above Lazio in the table.  That was the first time it had happened in five years, which delighted the Roma board, and Zeman stayed on for a further season.  The season also saw the international breakthrough of former youth-team product Francesco Totti, who at 21 was ready for increased responsibility and captaincy, responding with 13 league goals from a position on the left-wing of the attack.  Also noticeable was new signing Cafu's offensive skills as a right-wing back, granting him a reputation among the world's top wing backs. Associazione Sportiva Roma failed to defend their 2001 Serie A title, and had to settle for second best, whilst being beaten by Juventus.  Its main target for the season was to win the UEFA Champions League, which it failed when it got knocked out in the second group stage, rendering better form in the league when it did not have to rest players in those matches anymore.  The season highlight was a crushing 5–1 win over city rivals Lazio. The 2013–14 season was Associazione Sportiva Roma's 86th in existence and 85th season in the top flight of Italian football.  The pre-season started with the June hiring of Lille OSC manager Rudi García.  García replaced caretaker manager Aurelio Andreazzoli who took charge after the sacking of Zdeněk Zeman in February 2013.  Andreazzoli's reign had seen the continuation of a disappointing season, with the team ending up in 6th place in Serie A, whilst also losing 1–0 to regional rivals Lazio in the Coppa Italia final.  As a result, Roma missed out on European competition for the second season in a row.  The 2013–14 season, in contrast, saw one of Roma's best ever in Serie A, the club tallying an impressive 85 points and finishing second to Juventus, who won the league with a record-breaking 102 points.  Roma's defense was significantly better than in previous seasons, with only 25 goals conceded and a total of 21 clean sheets, including nine in their first ten matches. The 2017–18 season is Associazione Sportiva Roma's 90th in existence and 89th season in the top flight of Italian football.  The club will compete in Serie A, the Coppa Italia, and the UEFA Champions League, qualifying directly to the group stage after finishing runners-up to Juventus. Associazione Sportiva Roma was left trailing in the wake of city rivals Lazio's resurgence to fight for domestic and international glory.  In coach Zdeněk Zeman's second season at the reins, Roma finished fifth in the table, and just missed out on qualification for the final Champions League spot.  Roma reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, but lost to Atlético Madrid. The 2014–15 season was Associazione Sportiva Roma's 87th in existence and 86th season in the top flight of Italian football.  The team competed in Serie A, the Coppa Italia, the Champions League, and the Europa League.  Roma finished second behind Juventus for the second consecutive season after a poor run of form in 2015.  The club finished third in their Champions League group and thus dropped down to the Europa League, where they were knocked out by Fiorentina in the Round of 16.  Incidentally, Roma were also knocked out of the Coppa Italia by Fiorentina at the quarter-final stage, losing 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico. Associazione Sportiva Roma had a successful season, in which Sven-Göran Eriksson's typical Scandinavian tactical approach was able to improve Roma's fortunes to a level where they once again fought for the league title.  They also won the Coppa Italia, but the chance of a double disappeared in a 3–2 loss at home to bottom side Lecce, which all but secured Juventus's title.  The most important part in Roma's revival was an efficient midfield with several top-class players in addition to striker Roberto Pruzzo, with several playmakers providing multiple assists to league topscorer Pruzzo.", "com_question": "What is Rosella Sensi's birth date and birthplace?

The series takes place in Musashino, Tokyo, focusing on the serial street assaults caused by an unknown assailant known as Lil' Slugger, and the numerous persons who are affected by them. The Paranoia Complex is an unlicensed video game based on the pen and paper role-playing game \"Paranoia\".  It was released in 1989 by Magic Bytes for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.  It takes the form of a top-down maze shooter and reviews at the time pegged it as mediocre to poor. An enemy complex is in modern psychology a mental disorder in which a person falsely believes he or she is surrounded by enemies.  Additional disorders of the mind generally accompanied with an enemy complex include paranoia and low-self esteem. Paranoia is a dystopian science-fiction tabletop role-playing game originally designed and written by Greg Costikyan, Dan Gelber, and Eric Goldberg, and first published in 1984 by West End Games.  Since 2004 the game has been published under license by Mongoose Publishing.  The game won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Rules of 1984 and was inducted into the Origins Awards Hall of Fame in 2007.  \"Paranoia\" is notable among tabletop games for being more competitive than co-operative, with players encouraged to betray one another for their own interests, as well as for keeping a light-hearted, tongue in cheek tone despite its dystopian setting. James Brown Ray (February 19, 1794 – August 4, 1848) was an Indiana politician and the only Indiana Senate president pro tempore to be elevated to governor of the State of Indiana.  Ray served during a time when the state transitioned from personal politics to political parties, but never joined a party himself.  Taking office one week before his 31st birthday, he became the state's youngest governor and served from 1825 to 1831, the longest period for an Indiana governor under the state constitution of 1816.  During Ray's term as governor the state experienced a period of economic prosperity and a 45 percent population increase.  He supported projects that encouraged the continued growth and development of the young state, most notably internal improvements, Native American removal, codification of Indiana's laws, improved county and local government, and expanded educational opportunities.  Ray was known for his eccentricity and early promotion of a large-scale railroad system in the state.  His support for new railroad construction and alleged involvement in several scandals caused him to lose popularity among voters.  Ray's opponents who favored the creation of canals considered railroads to be an impractical, utopian idea.  Following Ray's departure from political office, he continued to advocate for a statewide railroad system until his death in 1848. Cousin marriage is marriage between cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents or people who share other fairly recent ancestors).  Opinions and practice vary widely across the world.  In some cultures and communities, cousin marriage is considered ideal and actively encouraged; in others, it is subject to social stigma.  Cousin marriage is common in the Middle East, for instance, where it accounts for over half of all marriages in some countries.  In some countries outside that region, it is uncommon but still legal.  In others, it is seen as incestuous and is legally prohibited: it is banned in China and Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, and in fewer than half of the United States.  Supporters of cousin marriage where it is banned may view the prohibition as discrimination, while opponents may appeal to moral or other arguments.  Worldwide, more than 10% of marriages are between first or second cousins. Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. The 1969–70 Washington Caps season was the 1st and only season of the Caps in the ABA.  On August 21, 1969, the Oakland Oaks moved to Washington, D.C due to operating at a loss despite winning the ABA Finals that year.  They were purchased by a group led by Earl Foreman, Thomas Shaheen and Louis Diamond for $2.6 million.  Seven members of the championship team played for the Caps, who finished 3rd in the Western Division (placed there despite being over thousands of miles from their opponents).  The team played a few games designated as home games despite not being in Washington, even playing a game in Wichita, Kansas.  They finished 2nd in points per game at 118.2, but finished last in points allowed, at 118.8.  The Caps faced the Denver Rockets in the ABA Playoffs, losing in 7 games.  After the season, Foreman was encouraged to move the team away from Washington, in anticipation of an ABA–NBA merger, along with Abe Pollin moving his Baltimore Bullets to Washington.

Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (] ; 10 November 17599 May 1805) was a German poet, philosopher, physician, historian, and playwright.  During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller struck up a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches.  This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism.  They also worked together on \"Xenien\", a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents to their philosophical vision. Slizer, also known as ThrowBots in the US, was a line of Lego toys released in early 1999.  The series was initially centered on eight characters, each with their own Lego set.  Each of the sets released in 1999 were thematically designed according to their habitat.  There were two loosely defined plots tying all the characters together, depending on localization.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_416", "context": "The 301st Rifle Division began service as a standard Red Army rifle division shortly after the German invasion, but was soon largely destroyed in the encirclement of Kiev, although enough of a cadre survived to form the basis of a second formation.  This new division began forming in the last days of 1941, and saw some limited service in the Second Battle of Kharkov, but then had to fall back in the face of the German summer offensive, became encircled quite early on, and had to be disbanded in July.  Nearly a year later a third 301st was raised, based on the personnel and equipment of two existing rifle brigades.  This incarnation of the division compiled a creditable record of service in several major offensives through Ukraine, then into Poland and up to the gates of Berlin in April, 1945, and also served briefly post-war in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, headquartered in Berlin. The 335th Rifle Division was first formed in September 1941, as a standard Red Army rifle division, at Stalingrad.  It was a \"sister\" unit to the 341st Rifle Division, which was formed at about the same time and place and shared a very similar combat path in its first formation.  The division was assigned to the southern sector of the Soviet-German front during the winter counteroffensive, but took severe losses during the German spring offensive that formed the Izium Pocket, and it was all but destroyed in the opening phase of Case Blue.  The division was formed again nearly two years later, this time in the Far Eastern Front, and spent the rest of the war mainly on coastal defense duties.  The 335th had one of the shortest and least distinguished careers of any Soviet rifle division. The 137th Rifle Corps was formed on 5 December 1945 in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, part of the Far Eastern Military District, from the Kamchatka Defense Region.  It was commanded by Lieutenant General Alexey Gnechko until May 1950.  Gnechko was a Hero of the Soviet Union and veteran of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.  The units of the corps were based in Kamchatka and the Northern Kuriles and included the 22nd Rifle Division, 101st Rifle Division and 255th Rifle Division.  In 1948, the 101st Rifle Division became the 6th Machine Gun Artillery Division, which was disbanded in 1953.  After the 1953 disbandment of the 14th Assault Army in Chukotka its 3rd and 8th Separate Rifle Brigades became part of the corps. The division was initially placed on \"cadre\" status, but in 1932 it was upgraded to a \"shock\" division and tank and motorizied elements were added.  In August 1939, as the Soviet Union began to mobilize and expand the army, the division was broken up to provide cadres for two new divisions.  The 2nd Rifle Regiment was used to form the 115th Rifle Division and the 3rd Rifle Regiment was used to form the 126th Rifle Division.  The 1st Rifle Regiment was then used to form new 1st Rifle Division. The 341st Rifle Division was first formed in September 1941, as a standard Red Army rifle division, at Stalingrad.  It was a \"sister\" unit to the 335th Rifle Division, which was formed at about the same time and place and shared a very similar combat path in its first formation.  It was assigned to the southern sector of the Soviet-German front during the winter counteroffensive, but was effectively destroyed during the German spring offensive that formed the Izium Pocket, and was soon disbanded.  The division was formed again almost exactly two years later, this time in the Karelian Front, facing Finland, and saw only limited action in the Continuation War before being assigned to coastal defense duties during 1945.  While the 341st had one of the shortest and least distinguished careers of any Soviet division in the Soviet-German War, it continued to serve well into the Cold War, eventually being re-designated and becoming a motorized rifle division. The 95th Rifle Division (Russian: 95-я стрелковая дивизия 95-y strelkovaya diviziya ) was a Red Army Rifle Division during World War II, formed thrice.  The division was first formed in November 1923 with the 6th Rifle Corps.  It fought in the Winter War and the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.  After Operation Barbarossa, the division fought in the retreat from Moldova and fought in the Siege of Odessa and the Siege of Sevastopol.  It was destroyed during the Siege of Sevastopol and was disbanded in late July 1942.  The division was reformed in August 1942 from the 13th Motor Rifle Division NKVD and fought at the Battle of Stalingrad.  For its actions during the battle, the division became the 75th Guards Rifle Division in March 1943.  In April 1943, the division was formed a third time at Kaluga from the 121st Rifle Brigade.  It fought in Operation Bagration. Andrusenko joined the Red Army in 1918, fighting in the Russian Civil War in Ukraine and the Polish–Soviet War.  During the interwar period, he became an infantry officer and studied at the Frunze Military Academy just before the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.  Andrusenko commanded two different rifle regiments in the Battle of Moscow before taking command of the 329th Rifle Division in December.  In March 1942, his division was encircled and destroyed.  Andrusenko escaped and was sentenced to death for \"inaction\", but the sentenced was changed to ten years and delayed until the end of the war.  He was demoted to command a cadet rifle brigade, which he led during the Battle of Stalingrad.  For an unauthorized retreat, he was again demoted to command of a regiment.  For his subsequent leadership of the regiment, Andrusenko was restored in rank and for his actions in the Battle of the Dnieper was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  In January 1944, he was given command of the 55th Rifle Division, leading it in Operation Bagration and the Baltic Offensive.  In the spring of 1945 Andrusenko took command of the 184th Rifle Division in the Soviet Far East and led it in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August of that year.  He retired from the army after the end of the war. Daniil Vasilievich Kazakevich (Russian: Даниил Васильевич Казакевич; 16 December 1902 – 28 November 1988) was a Belorussian Soviet Lieutenant general and Hero of the Soviet Union.  Kazakevich was drafted into the Red Army in 1920 and fought in the Polish–Soviet War.  In 1923 he transferred to the Soviet Border Troops.  Kazakevich became an officer and by 1939 was chief of staff of a border district in the Soviet Far East.  In December 1942 he became chief of staff of the Far Eastern NKVD Rifle Division, which became the 102nd Rifle Division some months later.  After fighting in Operation Kutuzov, Kazakevich was given command of the 399th Rifle Division in September 1943.  Kazakevich led the division through the Battle of the Dnieper, Operation Bagration and the East Prussian Offensive.  He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership in the battle for the Narew bridgeheads during September 1944.  Postwar, Kazakevich returned to the Border Troops and led the Moldovan and Southwestern Border Districts.  After a two-year period as an advisor to the East German Border Troops, Kazakevich became chief of the Border Troops military educational institutions.  He retired in 1959 and lived in Moscow, working in the Intourist Directorate. The 79th traces its history back to the formation of the Sakhalin Rifle Division on 17 August 1938.  In January 1939, the division became the 79th Mountain Rifle Division, commanded by Kombrig Ivan Makarenko.  In 1940, it was converted into the 79th Rifle Division.  It became part of the 16th Army's 56th Rifle Corps in 1943.  During August and September 1945, the division fought in the Invasion of South Sakhalin.  For its actions in the invasion, the division was awarded the honorific \"Sakhalin\".  During the battle for south Sakhalin, 179th Rifle Regiment Battalion commander Captain Leonid Smirnykh was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union after his battalion captured 5 bunkers and Smirnykh was killed by sniper fire.  Sergeant Anton Buyukly was also made a Hero of the Soviet Union posthumously in 1965 for his sacrifice in blocking a bunker firing slit with his body. Pyotr Filippovich Berestov (Russian: Пётр Филиппович Берестов ; December 21 [O.S. December 8] 1896 , Berestovo – November 26, 1961, Zaporozhye) was a Red Army major general during the Second World War.  Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1917, Berestov participated in the Russian Revolution.  He was drafted into the Red Army, fighting in the Russian Civil War and the Polish–Soviet War.  He became a Red Army officer and served in several positions during the interwar period.  Berestov was arrested and released during the Great Purge.  He fought in the Winter War as a regimental commander.  In the early days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was given command of a People's Militia regiment, which was converted into a regular regiment.  Berestov led the regiment in the early period of the Battle of Moscow and transferred to lead a regiment of the 82nd Motor Rifle Division.  Berestov became the division's commander and in the spring of 1942 briefly led the 50th Rifle Division.  In April, he took command of the 331st Rifle Division, which he led during the rest of the war.  For his leadership, Berestov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in late June 1945.  Postwar he commanded the 72nd Guards Rifle Division, which was downsized into a brigade, and the 43rd Guards Rifle Brigade, which became the 113th Guards Rifle Division.

Yuji Horii (堀井 雄二 , \"Horii Yūji\" ) (also written as Yuuji Horii) (born January 6, 1954 in Awaji Island, Japan) is a Japanese video game designer and scenario writer best known as the creator of the \"Dragon Quest\" series of role-playing games, supervising and writing the scenario for \"Chrono Trigger\", as well as the first visual novel adventure game \"Portopia Serial Murder Case\". Olaf Saile (27 August 1901 - 29 June 1952) was a German writer born in Weitingen, Württemberg.  Saile's principal claim to fame is the historical novel \"Kepler, Roman einer Zeitwende\" first published in German in Stuttgart in 1938 and many times reprinted.  It is an imagined biography of the life and times of the astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler.  The novel was translated into English by James A Galston and published in New York City in 1940 by Oskar Piest, under the title \"Troubadour of the Stars\".  The novel has occasionally been interpreted as a coded protest  against the Nazi régime which Saile had experienced at first hand.  Following the banning of the Social Democratic Party by the Nazis, in June 1933 as editor of the newspaper \"Rathenower Zeitung\", during the subsequent wave of arrests Olaf Saile was briefly detained in the Oranienburg Concentration Camp, during which time he was maltreated.

Gold was discovered here in 1938 by Fred W. Thompson and Roy Lundmark; they staked 46 claims that were incorporated into the mine.  Underground and shaft work began in 1939.  The mine processed 133,989 tons of ore to produce 70,339 troy ounces (2188 kg) of gold and 13,782 troy ounces (429 kg) of silver.  The abandoned site was destroyed by forest fires during 1998.  A detailed history is available in the link below. The Ptarmigan and Tom Mine were gold producers located in the Northwest Territories, Canada at Yellowknife.  The property was staked by prospectors in 1936 and acquired by Cominco in 1938.  The mine first produced between 1941 and 1942 but closed due to wartime restrictions.  The old property was demolished in 1969–1970.  A new company, Treminco Resources Limited, reopened the workings in 1985 and production from the Tom ( ) portal began in 1986 with material being trucked to Giant Mine.  The old Ptarmigan ( ) mine shaft was dewatered and production began in 1987.  A new mill was built at the property and was operational in July 1989.

The Shoemakers' Holiday, or the Gentle Craft is an Elizabethan play written by Thomas Dekker.  It is considered one of Dekker's greatest works, and is certainly his most well-known.  It was first performed in 1599 by the Admiral's Men.  It falls into the subgenre of city comedy.  It contains the poem, The Merry Month of May. The play was first published in 1600 by the printer Valentine Simmes.  The first edition prefaces the play with an \"Epistle to the Professors of the Gentle Craft,\" and the Prologue spoken before Queen Elizabeth when the play was acted at Court.  (The Admiral's Men performed at Court on 1 January 1600; this was probably the date of the performance of \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\"). Philip Henslowe's Diary records a payment of £3 to \"Thomas Dickers\" for the play; since this is at most half of Henslowe's usual fee for a play, one or more other payments, not recorded in the Diary, are likely.  This play followed in the tradition that Dekker had created for himself of depicting everyday life in London.  Due to this skill, in The Shoemaker's Holiday and other plays, Dekker was later called the \"Dickens of English theater\", due to his commitment to portraying the lives of Londoners.  Dekker based his play on a prose tract titled \"The Gentle Craft\", by Thomas Deloney, printed in 1598. Ruth Vollmer (1903 - 1982 New York City), was a German artist born in Munich.

Ruth begins work designing window displays for Bonwit Teller, Tiffany's, Lord & Taylor, and other department stores.  Her displays experimented with wire, steel, and copper mesh to create figural forms.  In 1943, Vollmer becomes a U.S. citizen.  In 1944 she receives a commission from the Museum of Modern Art for its fifteenth anniversary exhibition, \"Art in Progress.\"  Vollumer continues to work with wire mesh and shows her work \"Composition in Space\" at the Museum of Modern Art's 1948 exhibition \"Elements of Stage Design.\"  In 1950, she was commissioned to create a mural for the lobby of 575 Madison, where Vollmer created a large wall relief that used wire rods and wire mesh to play with light, texture, and transparency.  Vollumer visits Giacometti for a second time during the summer of 1951.  During the 1950s she begins to works with clay as well.  Additionally, in 1954 she begins to teach at the Children's Art Center at the Fieldston School in Riverdale and continued to teach until the mid-sixties.  In 1960, Vollmer participates in the NYU discussion series \"Artists on Art\" with her friend Robert Motherwell.  1960 is an important year because she also has her first one-person exhibition at Betty Parson's Section Eleven gallery space.

In 1963, she joins the group American Abstract Artists (AAA) and includes her work in their exhibitions from 1963 on.  By 1970 Vollmer's art is working with complex geometrical forms and mathematical concepts, particularly spirals and platonic solids.  Sol LeWitt wrote a short essay on Vollmer's work for \"Studio International\" titled \"Ruth Vollmer: Mathematical Forms.\"  Vollmer protests the cancellation of the Hans Haacke at The Solomon R.

Garland Anderson (February 18, 1886 – June 1, 1939) was an African-American playwright and speaker.  After having a full-length drama on Broadway, Anderson gave talks on empowerment and success largely related to the New Thought movement.  Born in Wichita, Kansas, his family moved to Sacramento, California.  Anderson left home at an early age, working as a newsboy, railroad porter and hotel bellhop.  In his late 30s he read a book about New Thought, saw a play by Channing Pollack and thought that his life experience and new attitude had the makings of a play.  Anderson wrote the initial version of \"Appearances\"; with the assistance of Al Jolson, the play (the first three-act play by an African American) was produced on Broadway.  Although it was not a success, Anderson's industry and can-do attitude were appreciated.  The play was produced several times and toured the US and the UK.  Anderson settled in the UK, inventing a malted-milk product and giving religious talks.  He received support from Dean of Canterbury Dick Sheppard, and returned to the US for a speaking tour.  During the tour, he became a New Thought minister and married Doris Sequirra.  After their return to England, she wrote a book about their experiences which was published in the UK and the US.  Anderson wrote other plays and books; in early 1939 he was promoting his book, \"Uncommon Sense\", as a possible play.  After having a heart attack in London, he died in New York a few days after his return.  Anderson was cremated, and Doris brought his remains back to the UK.

He has written seven novels in his ‘Crowby’ series, featuring the present-day investigations of Inspector Jacobson and his team of provincial police detectives.  The Crowby novels broadly follow the conventions of the police procedural but they are distinguished by an unusual narrative emphasis on the point of view of their non-police protagonists.

The first issue was titled \"The Magazine of Fantasy\", but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy, and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue.  \"F&SF\" was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day, most of which were in pulp format: it had no interior illustrations, no letter column, and text in a single column format, which in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley \"set \"F&SF\" apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine\".

In the United States a contingent surplus note is a bond-like instrument issued by an insurance company.  These securities are subordinated obligations, and fall at the very bottom of the operating insurance company's capital structure.  They are issued primarily by mutual insurance companies, which are not public and owned instead by their policy holders.  Surplus notes are debt-like in that they pay a coupon and have a finite maturity.  However, in many cases, state insurance regulators have allowed insurance companies to classify the capital raised via surplus notes as “surplus” (which is the statutory equivalent of equity), because surplus note holders are last in line to make a claim on the company's assets in a default scenario, much like where equity holders reside in a public company.  The motivation for mutual companies to issue these instruments was to raise surplus (or equity) in response to new risk-based capital guidelines developed in the early 1990s.  Because mutual companies are owned by policyholders, not shareholders, there was no alternative method to raise surplus or equity.  While surplus note holders have last claim on the assets of the operating insurance company, it is important to realize that this claim is at the operating company level, which is still ahead of holding company obligations.

A third-party administrator (TPA) is an organization that processes insurance claims or certain aspects of employee benefit plans for a separate entity.  It is also a term used to define organizations within the Insurance industry which \"administer\" other services such as Underwriting, Customer Service and the like.  This can be viewed as \"outsourcing\" the administration of the claims processing, since the TPA is performing a task traditionally handled by the company providing the insurance or the company itself.  Often, in the case of insurance claims, a TPA handles the claims processing for an employer that self-insures its employees.  Thus, the employer is acting as an insurance company and underwrites the risk.  The risk of loss remains with the employer, and not with the TPA.  An insurance company may also use a TPA to manage its claims processing, provider networks, utilization review, or membership functions.  While some third-party administrators may operate as units of insurance companies, they are often independent.

It is the only extant Scent hound breed native to Ireland. The Belgian Shepherd (also known as the Belgian Sheepdog or Chien de Berger Belge) is a breed of medium-to-large-sized herding dog.  It originated in Belgium and is similar to other sheep herding dogs from that region, including the Dutch Shepherd, the German Shepherd, the Briard, and others.  Four types have been identified by various registries as separate breeds or varieties: Groenendael, Laekenois, Tervuren, and Malinois. Beagle: In het kielzog van Darwin (English: \"Beagle: In Darwin's wake\") was a Dutch-Flemish television series from 2009 and 2010 initiated by the VPRO in collaboration with Teleac (Dutch educational broadcaster) and Canvas to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\".  The series is centered on an 8-month voyage around the world on board of the clipper Stad Amsterdam which follows the route of the five-year-long voyage of Charles Darwin on board of the ship HMS Beagle between 1831 and 1836.  The Stad Amsterdam departed from the English port of Plymouth on September 1, 2009. The Dutch Shepherd is a herding dog of Dutch origin.  They were used by shepherds and farmers who needed a versatile dog, with few demands, and a dog that was able to adapt to a harsh and meager existence. The Bedford Beagle was an estate car conversion of the Bedford HA 8cwt van, which itself was based on the Vauxhall Viva HA.  The conversions were undertaken by Martin Walter Ltd in Folkestone, Kent, most famous for Dormobile campers based upon the larger Bedford CA commercial vans.  Whilst the vans were very common at one time, the Beagle was altogether rarer and there are very few left today. Beagle Bag is a collection of video games for the Apple II family of computers published in 1982 by Beagle Bros Software.  In common with their other titles, the \"Beagle Bag\" software was released in unlocked and unprotected form, and is now in the public domain. A Husky Beagle, or Cornish Husky, is a type of dog bred between a male Husky and female Beagle.  Similar in appearance to a Husky, a Husky Beagle maintains the look of a Husky with a stance of a small hound Beagle.  The working breed measures 15-21 inches with a weight of 35 to 55 pounds.  This dog type is an animal cross-breed between a tempered Husky and affectionate beagle, taking floppy ears from their beagle mother and soft appearance from a counterpart husky father. Beagle Brigade is a team of beagles and their human handlers who, as part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), inspect luggage at U.S. airports searching for agricultural products.

The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. Dutch barn is the name given to markedly different types of barns in the United States and Canada, and in the United Kingdom.  In the United States, Dutch barns (a. k. a. New World Dutch barns) represent the oldest and rarest types of barns.  There are relatively few—probably fewer than 600—of these barns still intact.  Common features of these barns include a core structure composed of a steep gabled roof, supported by purlin plates and anchor beam posts, the floor and stone piers below.  Little of the weight is supported by the curtain wall, which could be removed without affecting the stability of the structure.  Large beams of pine or oak bridge the center aisle for animals to provide room for threshing.  Entry was through paired doors on the gable ends with a pent roof over them, and smaller animal doors at the corners of the same elevations.  The Dutch Barn has a square profile, unlike the more rectangular English or German barns.  In the United Kingdom a structure called a Dutch barn is a relatively recent agricultural development meant specifically for hay and straw storage; most examples were built from the 19th century.  British Dutch barns represent a type of pole barn in common use today.  Design styles range from fixed roof to adjustable roof; some Dutch barns have honeycombed brick walls, which provide ventilation and are decorative as well.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_435", "context": "The General Electric F118 is a non-afterburning turbofan engine produced by GE Aviation, and is derived from the General Electric F110 afterburning turbofan. The Vickers-Armstrongs V-1000 was an intended jet-powered cargo aircraft that was designed to meet a requirement issued by the British Ministry of Supply which sought a strategic transport for the Royal Air Force (RAF) to support its strategic bomber fleet, particularly the V-bombers.  The design bears many similarities to the Vickers Valiant, one of the V-bombers, but also featured substantial changes.  In addition to its military application, both the Ministry and Vickers also intended to use the same basic design as the VC7, a six-abreast trans-Atlantic jet airliner for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The General Electric TF39 was a high-bypass turbofan engine developed to power the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.  The TF39 was the very first high-power, high-bypass jet engine ever developed.  The TF39 was further developed into the CF6 series of engines, and formed the basis of the General Electric LM2500 marine and industrial gas turbine.  On September 7, 2017 the very last active C-5A powered with TF39 engines made its final flight to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for retirement.  The TF39 was effectively retired and all remaining active C-5 Galaxys are now powered with General Electric F138-GE-100 engines. The General Electric CF6 is a family of high-bypass turbofan engines produced by GE Aviation.  Based on the TF39, the first high-power high-bypass jet engine, the CF6 powers a wide variety of civilian airliners.  The basic engine core also powers the LM2500, LM5000, and LM6000 marine and power generation turboshafts. The General Electric T64 is a free-turbine turboshaft engine that was originally developed for use on helicopters, but which was later used on fixed-wing aircraft as well.  General Electric introduced the engine in 1964.  The original engine design included technical innovations such as corrosion resistant and high-temperature coatings.  The engine features a high overall pressure ratio, yielding a low specific fuel consumption for its time.  Although the compressor is all-axial, like the earlier General Electric T58, the power turbine shaft is coaxial with the HP shaft and delivers power to the front of the engine, not rearwards.  Fourteen compressor stages are required to deliver the required overall pressure ratio.  Compressor handling is facilitated by 4 rows of variable stators.  Unlike the T58, the power turbine has 2 stages. The Messerschmitt Me 264 was a long-range strategic bomber developed during World War II for the German \"Luftwaffe\".  It was intended to serve as Germany's main strategic bomber.  The design was later selected as Messerschmitt's competitor in the \"Reichsluftfahrtministerium\"' s (the German Air Ministry) \"Amerika Bomber\" programme, which intended to develop a strategic bomber capable of attacking New York City from bases in France or the Azores.  Three prototypes were built, but production was abandoned to allow Messerschmitt to concentrate on fighter production while another design, the Junkers Ju 390, had been selected in its place as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The General Electric F110 is an afterburning turbofan jet engine produced by GE Aviation.  The F110 engine uses the same engine core design as the General Electric F101.  The F118 is a non-afterburning variant.  The engine is also license-built in Eskisehir, Turkey by TUSAŞ Engine Industries (TEI). The General Electric GE4 turbojet engine was designed in the late 1960s as the powerplant for the Boeing 2707 supersonic transport.  The GE4 was a nine-stage, single-shaft, axial-flow turbojet based largely on the General Electric YJ93 which powered the North American XB-70 bomber.  The GE4 was the most powerful engine of its era, producing 50000 lbf dry, and 65000 lbf with afterburner.  The Boeing 2707 was cancelled in 1971, putting an end to further work on the GE4. Rebellion (Derby) Ltd (formerly Core Design Limited) was a British video game developer based in Derby, England.  Founded in May 1988 by former Gremlin Graphics employees, it originally bore the name Megabrite until rebranding as Core Design in October the same year.  The company was acquired by umbrella company CentreGold in 1994, which in turn was acquired by Eidos Interactive in April 1996.  Following the latter acquisition, Core Design was re-organised as a subsidiary of Eidos Interactive, while other CentreGold components were either closed or sold off.  In May 2006, the Core Design personnel and assets were acquired by Rebellion Developments, and the company became Rebellion Derby. The General Electric F101 is an afterburning turbofan jet engine.

Ringo Lam Ling-Tung (, Cantonese: Lam Ling-tung), is a Hong Kong film director, producer, and screenwriter.  Born in Hong Kong in 1955, Lam initially went to an acting school.  After finding he preferred making films to acting, he went to Canada to study film.  In 1983, he returned and began filming comedy films.  After the commercial success of his film \"Aces Go Places IV\", he was allowed to develop his own film.

White claimed that many key elements of \"Reservoir Dogs\" were borrowed from \"City on Fire\", a claim he later illustrated via his own short film, \"Who Do You Think You're Fooling?\" , while Rotten Tomatoes attempted to do the same via one of their \"Homage or Stealing?\"  features.

Qikiqtaaluk is the traditional Inuktitut name for Baffin Island.  Although the Qikiqtaaluk Region is the most commonly used name in official contexts, several notable public organisations, including Statistics Canada prefer the older term Baffin Region. Loks Land Island is part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in Nunavut, Canada.  It is located off the eastern tip of Baffin Island's Blunt Peninsula, close to the mouth of Frobisher Bay.

Hiorthhamn is an abandoned settlement located on the east side of Adventfjorden on the island of Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway.  It served as a coal mining camp from 1917 to 1921 operated by De Norske Kullfelter Spitsbergen.  The settlement was named for the company's director, Fredrik Hiorth (1851–1923).  Muskox were introduced in the area from Greenland in 1929, and the camp took the name Moskushamn in 1938.  It reverted to its original name in 2002.

Seabirds include some of the most threatened taxa anywhere in the world.  For example, of extant albatross species, 82% are listed as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  The two leading threats to seabirds are accidental bycatch by commercial fishing operations and introduced mammals on their breeding islands.  Mammals are typically brought to remote islands by humans either accidentally as stowaways on ships, or deliberately for hunting, ranching, or biological control of previously introduced species.  Introduced mammals have a multitude of negative effects on seabirds including direct and indirect effects.  Direct effects include predation and disruption of breeding activities, and indirect effects include habitat transformation due to overgrazing and major shifts in nutrient cycling due to a halting of nutrient subsidies from seabird excrement.  There are other invasive species on islands that wreak havoc on native bird populations (e.g. brown snakes on Guam), but mammals are by far the most commonly introduced species to islands and the most detrimental to breeding seabirds.  Despite efforts to remove introduced mammals from these remote islands, invasive mammals are still present on roughly 80% of islands worldwide. The muskox (\"Ovibos moschatus\"), also spelled musk ox and musk-ox (in Inuktitut: ᐅᒥᖕᒪᒃ, \"umingmak\" ), is an Arctic mammal of the family Bovidae, noted for its thick coat and for the strong odor emitted during the seasonal rut by males, from which its name derives.  This musky odor is used to attract females during mating season.  Its Inuktitut name \"umingmak\" translates to \"the bearded one\".  Muskoxen primarily live in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland, with small introduced populations in Alaska, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and Siberia. The Sadlermiut (also called Sagdlirmiut, or Sallirmiut in modern Inuktitut spelling, from \"Sadlerk\" now \"Salliq\", the Inuktitut name for the settlement of Coral Harbour, Nunavut) were an Inuit group living in near isolation mainly on and around Coats Island, Walrus Island, and Southampton Island in Hudson Bay.  They survived into the early twentieth century and were thought by some to have been the last remnants of the Dorset culture as they had preserved a distinct culture and dialect from the mainland Inuit.  Despite their culture and local traditions seeming to show combined elements of both the Dorset and Thule societies, recent genetic studies show no Dorset admixture and prove a sole Inuit ancestry leading many to conclude the cultural difference may be entirely due to their isolation from the mainland Inuit.  Research published in 2015, found that the Sadlermiut were genetically Thule who had somehow acquired Dorset cultural features, like stone technology.

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_445", "context": "The Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston, a combined statistical area, has had glimpses of the religion in the 19th century arising to its first community of religionists at the turn of the century.  Early newspaper accounts of events were followed by papers on the precursor Bábí religion by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright were noted, materials donated, and lost, and then other scholars began to write about the religion.  The community began to coalesce being near to Green Acre, founded by Sarah Farmer, who publicly espoused the religion from 1901.  From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Bahá'ís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913.  Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, traveled through the area for about 40 days and across the United States for some 239 days.  Most prominent were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt, who served in events in the Boston area, Green Acre boards, and national institutions of the religion.  In addition to national leaders in the religion, a number of notable individuals joined the religion and were increasingly visible - such as Urbain Ledoux, James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., Nancy Bowditch, and Guy Murchie.  The community moved from beginning to host public meetings to systematically support a presence in a Center in Boston with services and presentations on the religion.  Starting about the 1950s and broadening into the 1960s there was wider recognition of the Bahá'ís themselves.  Sometimes this took the form of noting their persecution in Morocco and then Iran and other times noting local concerts and fairs with their participation.  The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area.  Over the last couple of decades it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children’s classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion. King Edward VI School was founded about 1550 and has occupied a number of sites in the town prior to moving to the current location in 1972.  It is believed there was a school in Bury St Edmunds from the 10th century.  In 903 the body of King Edmund was laid in the priests' college, of which the school was a part.  King Canute established a Benedictine Monastery in Bury, and paid from the royal purse for boys of promise, even freed sons of slaves, to attend school.  In 1550 lands were given to provide funds for a \"\"scole ther to be founded by the kinges Maiestie in the like manner as the school at Sherbourne\"\". The former Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Crediton, Devon, England was founded (as The Kyng's Newe Gramer Scole of Credyton) in 1547 by Edward VI and re-endowed and renamed in 1559 by Elizabeth I. The Center for Media, Religion, and Culture is a research center in the University of Colorado's College of Media, Communication and Information, that aims at cultivating knowledge and promoting research on the representation and interpretation of religion in popular media, both inside and outside the U.S.  The center was founded in 2006 by Professor Stewart M. Hoover, a Journalism and Mass Communication faculty known for his work on popular media and religions. <ref<a href=\"http%3A//www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/media-studies/stewart-m-hoover\"»\"Stewart M.

Web.  6 July 2015</ref> In addition to hosting several international conferences that address current issues in media, religion and culture, the center offers fellowship programs for domestic and international scholars interested in conducting research on related subjects.  The Center takes on various projects with research fellows to explore religion and media from varied angles and through new, developing theoretical frameworks.  The Center aims to bring together scholars, professionals and the larger public to explore the variety of ways media and religion influence one another and our daily lives.  The Center currently works on several projects including one on the \"Third Spaces\" of Religion and Media, as well as a project in conjunction with the University of Haifa, in Israel on Media Ambivalence.  The Center also produces a radio show and has a group research blog. The Royal Grammar School, Guildford (originally \"The Free School\"), commonly known as the RGS, is a selective independent day school for boys in Guildford, Surrey in England.  The school dates its founding to the death of Robert Beckingham in 1509 who left provision in his will to 'make a free scole at the Towne of Guldford'; in 1512 a governing body was set up to form the school.  The school moved to the present site in the upper High Street after the granting of a royal charter from King Edward VI in 1552.  Around that time, its pupils were playing cricket and their activity was later documented as the earliest definite reference to the sport.  The school's Old Building, constructed between 1557 and 1586, is the home of a rare example of a chained library.  It was established on the death of John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich, in 1575.  Although defined as a \"free\" school, the first statutes of governance, approved in 1608, saw the introduction of school fees, at the rate of 4 shillings per annum, along with the school's first admissions test.  During the late 19th century the school ran into financial difficulty, which nearly resulted in the closure of the school.  A number of rescue options were explored, including amalgamation with Archbishop Abbott's School.  Funds were eventually raised, however, which allowed the school to remain open, although boarding was no longer offered. Jupiter, also known as Jove (Latin: \"Iūpiter\" ] or \"Iuppiter\" ] , gen.  \"Iovis\" ] ), is the god of the sky and thunder and king of the gods in Ancient Roman religion and mythology.

Law and religion is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between law, especially public law, and religion.  Vogel reports that in the 1980s a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the \"Journal of Law and Religion\" first published that year.  The \"Ecclesiastical Law Journal\" began publication in 1987.  The \"The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion\" was founded in 1999.  \"The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion\" was founded in England in 2012.

As their marriage was in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, it was considered legally void, and she could not be styled either as the Duchess of Sussex nor a Princess.  She was created Duchess of Inverness, in her own right, by Queen Victoria, on 10 April 1840. Lady Augusta Murray (27 January 1768 – 5 March 1830) was the first wife of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the sixth son of George III.  As their marriage was in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, it was considered legally void, and she could not be styled as the Duchess of Sussex. The Royal Marriages Act 1772 was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain, which prescribed the conditions under which members of the British Royal Family could contract a valid marriage, in order to guard against marriages that could diminish the status of the royal house.  The right of veto vested in the sovereign by this act provoked severe adverse criticism at the time of its passage.  It was repealed on 26 March 2015 as a result of the 2011 Perth Agreement.  Its provisions were replaced by more limited restrictions that apply only to the first six people in the line of succession (currently Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Harry, and Prince Andrew). Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (Henry Frederick; 7 November 1745 – 18 September 1790) was the sixth child and fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III.  His 1771 marriage to a commoner against the King's wishes prompted the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 . The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, Act No 55 of 1949, was an apartheid law in South Africa that prohibited marriages between \"Europeans\" and \"non-Europeans\".  It was among the first pieces of apartheid legislation to be passed following the National Party's rise to power in 1948.  Subsequent legislation, especially the Population Registration and Immorality Acts of 1950, facilitated its implementation by requiring all individuals living in South Africa to register as a member of one of four officially defined racial groups and prohibiting extramarital sexual relationships between people of different races. Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (Charlotte Elizabeth Diana; born 2 May 2015) is the younger child and only daughter of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.  She is fourth in line of succession to the British throne, after her paternal grandfather, her father, and her elder brother. James, Viscount Severn (James Alexander Philip Theo Mountbatten-Windsor; born 17 December 2007) is the younger child and only son of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and the youngest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.  He is tenth in line of succession to the British throne. Sarah Fairbrother (calling herself \"Louisa\" and known from 1859 as \"Mrs FitzGeorge\"; 31 October 1816 – 12 January 1890) was an English actress and the mistress of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, a male-line grandson of George III.  As the couple married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, their marriage was not recognised under the law. Colonel George William Adolphus FitzGeorge (24 August 1843 – 2 September 1907) was a great-grandson of King George III of the United Kingdom and first cousin to Queen Mary, being the eldest of the three sons of the 2nd Duke of Cambridge and Louisa Fairbrother (the other sons were Admiral Sir Adolphus FitzGeorge and Colonel Sir Augustus FitzGeorge).  As his parents were married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, he was ineligible to succeed his father as Duke of Cambridge and along with his siblings did not hold royal titles. Sir Augustus Frederick d'Este, (13 January 1794 – 28 December 1848) was the son of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, and Lady Augusta Murray, and a grandson of King George III.  His parents were secretly married on 4 April 1793, in a Church of England ceremony in the Hotel Sarmiento, Rome, and later married again on 5 December 1793 at St George's, Hanover Square, Westminster, using their correct names but without revealing their identities.  Both marriages were in defiance of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and were thus legally null and void, at least in English law.  After the birth of their first child, the marriage was discovered by the King and formally annulled, making their son illegitimate in Great Britain.", "com_question": "What is her name?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_455", "context": "Observatory Inlet is an inlet on the North Coast of British Columbia.  It is a northward extension of Portland Inlet, other sidewaters of which include the Portland Canal.  The entrance of Observatory Inlet, from Portland Inlet, lies between Ramsden Point and Nass Point.  Ramsden Point also marks, to the west, the entrance of Portland Canal.  Observatory Inlet was named by George Vancouver in 1793, because he set up his observatory on the shore of the inlet, at Salmon Cove, in order to calibrate his chronometers.  His two vessels, HMS \"Discovery\" and HMS \"Chatham\", stayed in Salmon Cove from July 23 to August 17, 1793.  During this time a boat surveying expedition under Vancouver himself explored Behm Canal.  Vancouver also named three headlands at the entrance of Observatory Inlet: Maskelyne Point, for Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, Wales Point, for William Wales, the mathematical master who sailed with James Cook, and Ramsden Point, after the famed mathematical instrument-maker Jesse Ramsden. Portland Inlet is an inlet of the Pacific Ocean on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, approximately 55 kilometers north of Prince Rupert, British Columbia.  It joins the Chatham Sound opposite the Dixon Entrance.  It is 40 kilometers long and as much as 13 kilometers wide.  It drains the Portland Canal, Nass River, and Khutzeymateen Inlet, among others, and is the site of Pearse Island and Somerville Island.  Other than Nass Bay and the Portland Canal, other major sidewaters of the inlet are Observatory Inlet and its east arm, Alice Arm. A predecessor to the Class I Delaware and Hudson Railway, the 1820s-built Delaware and Hudson Canal Company Gravity Railroad \"('D&H Gravity Railroad')\" was a historic gravity railroad incorporated and chartered in 1826 with land grant rights in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania as a humble subsidiary of the Delaware and Hudson Canal and it proved to contain the first trackage of the \"later organized Delaware and Hudson Railroad\" (so eventually became a first class Class I Railroad).  It began as the second long U.S. gravity railroad built initially to haul coal to canal boats, was the second railway chartered in the United States after the Mohawk and Hudson Rail Road before even, the Baltimore and Ohio (e. 1827).  As a long gravity railway, only the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad (e. 1827) pre-dated its beginning of operations. The Schenectady and Duanesburgh Railroad, incorporated in July 1873, was a predecessor of the Delaware and Hudson Railway that owned the 14.2 mi line between the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad at Schenectady and the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad at Delanson.  It was incorporated on December 27, 1869, as the Schenectady and Susquehanna Railroad, and opened in about August 1872, always leased to the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.  The property was sold under foreclosure on July 10, 1873, and conveyed to the Schenectady and Duanesburgh Railroad on July 12.  The company was merged into the Delaware and Hudson Company on August 4, 1903. The Delaware and Hudson Canal was the first venture of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, which would later build the Delaware and Hudson Railway.  Between 1828 and 1899, the canal's barges carried anthracite coal from the mines of Northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River and thence to market in New York City. The Delaware and Hudson Canal Museum is a museum in High Falls, New York, United States specializing in the history and culture of the Delaware and Hudson Canal.  It is located in a Gothic Revival chapel built in 1885 which was purchased by the Delaware & Hudson Canal Historical Society in 1975.  The building is a contributing property to the High Falls Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Portland Canal is an arm of Portland Inlet, one of the principal inlets of the British Columbia Coast.  It is approximately 114 km long.  The Portland Canal forms part of the border between southeastern Alaska and British Columbia.  The name of the entire inlet in the Nisga'a language is K'alii Xk'alaan, with /xk/alaan/ meaning \"at the back of (someplace)\".  The upper end of the inlet was home to the Tsetsaut (\"Jits'aawit\" in Nisga'a), who after being decimated by war and disease were taken under the protection of the Laxsgiik (Eagle) chief of the Nisga'a, who holds the inlet's title in native law. Charles Stewart Wurts (1790-1859) was a founder of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, which built the Delaware and Hudson Canal and later became the Delaware and Hudson Railway.  Along with his brothers, he helped launch the anthracite industry in America. The Louisville and Portland Canal was a 2 mi canal bypassing the Falls of the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky.  The Falls form the only barrier to navigation between the origin of the Ohio at Pittsburgh and the port of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico; circumventing them was long a goal for Pennsylvanian and Cincinnatian merchants.  The canal opened in 1830 as the private Louisville and Portland Canal Company but was gradually bought out during the 19th century by the federal government, which had invested heavily in its construction, maintenance, and improvement.  The Louisville and Portland Canal became the McAlpine Locks and Dam in 1962 after extensive modernization. Bristol is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 23 mi northeast of Center City Philadelphia, opposite Burlington, New Jersey on the Delaware River.  Bristol was first incorporated in 1720 but historically, after 1834 became very important to the development of the American Industrial Revolution as the terminus city of the Delaware Canal providing greater Philadelphia with the days High Tech Anthracite fuels from the Lehigh Canal via Easton.  The canal and a short trip on the Delaware also gave the town access to the mineral resources available in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York via each of the Morris Canal, the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, and connected the community to those markets and trade from New York City.  All these factors spurred development of Bristol and nearby towns, explaining in part the industries which developed in the region.", "com_question": "What year was the Louisville and Portland Canal opened?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_456", "context": "\"Perchance to Dream\" is a phrase from the \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy spoken by Shakespeare's Hamlet.  The words have been used as a title for: Maat Kheru (Egyptian: \"mꜣꜥ ḫrw\" ) is a phrase meaning \"true of voice\" or \"justified\" or \"the acclaim given to him is 'right'\".  The term is involved in ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs, according to which deceased souls had to be judged morally righteous.  Once the soul had passed the test, the Weighing of the Heart, he or she was judged to be \"mꜣꜥ ḫrw\" and was allowed to enter the afterlife.  The phrase was often used to denote someone who had passed and become a god by placing it in the name of the individual in question. A noble savage is a literary stock character who embodies the concept of the indigene, outsider, wild human, or \"other\" who has not been \"corrupted\" by civilization, and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness.  In English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in John Dryden's heroic play \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1672), wherein it was used in reference to newly created man.  \"Savage\" at that time could mean \"wild beast\" as well as \"wild man\".  The phrase later became identified with the idealized picture of \"nature's gentleman\", which was an aspect of 18th-century sentimentalism.  The noble savage achieved prominence as an oxymoronic rhetorical device after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by English novelist Charles Dickens, whom some believe may have wished to disassociate himself from what he viewed as the \"feminine\" sentimentality of 18th and early 19th-century romantic primitivism. The happy hunting ground was the name given to the concept of the afterlife by several of the Great Plains tribes of American Indians, including the Oglala Lakota.  It is an afterlife conceived of as a paradise in which hunting is plentiful and game unlimited. The world to come, age to come, or heaven on Earth are eschatological phrases reflecting the belief that the current world or current age is flawed or cursed and will be replaced in the future by a better world, age, or paradise.  The concept is related but differs from the concepts of heaven, the afterlife, and the Kingdom of God in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the Kingdom of God could be in the present (such as Realized eschatology) or the future. Pluto (, \"Ploutōn \") was the ruler of the underworld in classical mythology.  The earlier name for the god was Hades, which became more common as the name of the underworld itself.  In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife.  \"Ploutōn\" was frequently conflated with \"Ploutos\" (Πλοῦτος, Plutus), a god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because as a chthonic god Pluto ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest.  The name \"Ploutōn\" came into widespread usage with the Eleusinian Mysteries, in which Pluto was venerated as a stern ruler but the loving husband of Persephone.  The couple received souls in the afterlife, and are invoked together in religious inscriptions.  Hades, by contrast, had few temples and religious practices associated with him, and he is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone. To be, or not to be is the opening phrase of a soliloquy spoken by Prince Hamlet in the so-called \"nunnery scene\" of William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\".  Act III, Scene I. The 13-episode Japanese anime television series \"Angel Beats! \" is based on an original concept by Jun Maeda with original character design by Na-Ga; both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key known for producing such titles as \"Kanon\", \"Air\", and \"Clannad\".  It is directed by Seiji Kishi and produced by the animation studio P.A.Works and production company Aniplex.  Chief animator Katsuzō Hirata is also the character designer and the screenplay was written by Maeda.  The music, composed by Maeda and the group Anant-Garde Eyes, is produced by Aniplex with Satoki Iida as the sound director.  The plot takes place in the afterlife and follows the main protagonist Otonashi, a boy who lost his memories of his life after dying.  He is enrolled into the afterlife school and meets a girl named Yuri who invites him to join the Afterlife Battlefront (死んだ世界戦線 , Shinda Sekai Sensen (SSS) ) —an organization she leads which fights against God.  The SSS fight against the student council president Angel, a girl with supernatural powers. Mortal coil is a poetic term that means the troubles of daily life and the strife and suffering of the world.  It is used in the sense of a burden to be carried or abandoned, such as in the phrase \"shuffle[d] off this mortal coil\" from the \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\". Undiscovered Country is a 1979 Tom Stoppard play first produced at the Olivier Theatre in London.  The play is an adaptation of \"Das Weite Land\" by the Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler, which focuses on 1890s Viennese society, demonstrating the effects of upper class codes of behavior on human relationships.  The main character is a self-made businessman named Friedrich Hofreiter who manages to be both charming and chauvinistic.  Stoppard's alterations to the play consist of adding humor while lessening the melodrama.

These Organized crime groups or criminal organizations are a transnational grouping of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals for the purpose of engaging in illegal activity, most commonly for the purpose of generating a monetary profit.  The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (federal statute - Public Law 09-351) states, \"Organized crime means the unlawful activities of members of a highly organized, disciplined association...\" They are called a number of different names including: the Mafia (US, Italy), Yakuza (Japan), Chinese Triads, the Irish Mob, the Neapolitan Camorra, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, the Indian Mafia, the Unione Corse, Serbian Mafia, and the Bulgarian mafia. Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.

Members within the faction have held top leadership position in the Genovese crime family dating back to the 1930s with underboss Guarino \"Willie\" Moretti.  From the 1990s until his death in 2010, Tino \"the Greek\" Fiumara had been in control of the New Jersey faction. Carl \"Cork\" Civella (January 28, 1910 – October 2, 1994) was the leader of the Kansas City crime family following the death of his brother, long-time crime boss Nicholas Civella, after heading day-to-day operations during the mid-1970s.

He is the co-writer of the book \"Exit Føroyar\" (which means \"Exit Faroe Islands\"); he wrote it together with Heri á Rógvi.  The books was published in 2012 and created a major debate in the Faroe Islands and in Denmark about the problems the Faroe Islands were facing with population decline in the islands, where the biggest problems seemed to be that half of the young people who moved away to study abroad never moved back again; especially the women did not move back again.  After a period of six years with negative net migration in the Faroe Islands, the country saw an increase in the population in 2014 and 2015. Mir iskusstva (Russian: «Мир искусства» ; ] , \"World of Art\") was a Russian magazine and the artistic movement it inspired and embodied, which was a major influence on the Russians who helped revolutionize European art during the first decade of the 20th century.

NeoSon is an artistic movement developed in Guadalajara, Mexico, by a group of local artists, Josué Pérez being its main exponent.  The movement was started in the early 1990s after a two-year tour by Pérez and Carlos \"Charly\" Garcia (one of the best multi-instrumentalists in the country) through 13 countries in Latin America, especially Brazil.  The genesis was prompted by Pérez's perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on.  Although Mexican art has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the country's artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and Argentina.  This separation was particularly felt after the concert of Avándaro (regarded as the Mexican Woodstock) in 1971, after which rock music in the country was object of repressions by the government, the media and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984.  The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians' (and artists in general) creative and social objectives.

In this particular case the Court was unwilling to give President Abraham Lincoln's administration the power of military commission jurisdiction, part of the administration's controversial plan to deal with Union dissenters during the American Civil War.  Justice David Davis, who delivered the majority opinion, stated that \"martial rule can never exist when the courts are open\" and confined martial law to areas of \"military operations, where war really prevails,\" and when it was a necessity to provide a substitute for a civil authority that had been overthrown.  Chief Justice Chase and three associate justices filed a separate opinion concurring with the majority in the judgment, but asserted that Congress had the power to authorize a military commission, although it had not done so in Milligan's case. Ex parte McQuillon, 16 F. Cas.  347 (1861), was a case decided in August 1861 by United States district court for the southern district of New York involving a writ of habeas corpus.  Judge Betts issued the writ for Purcell McQuillon, who was being held in military custody at Fort Lafayette, but the commandant of the fort declined to bring McQuillon before the court as demanded, citing an order from Gen. Winfield Scott.  Over the objection of McQuillon's attorney, Judge Betts took no further action on the case, declaring that it would be indecorous to openly disagree with Chief Justice Taney's reasoning in \"ex parte Merryman\", but that the Constitution must be defended in whatever way it can be and the public would not want everyone to have access to habeas corpus during the Civil War.

At this time, further amendments of the patent application are allowed only to correct formal objections, which typically include minor and obvious mistakes.  The presence of such formal objections precludes the full closing of prosecution; therefore, in these situations, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues an \"Ex parte Quayle\" Office action requesting the applicant to correct the formal objections. During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases.  In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice.

Lambdin Purdy Milligan (March 24, 1812 – December 21, 1899) was a lawyer and farmer who was known for his extreme opinions on states' rights and his opposition to the Lincoln administration's conduct of the American Civil War.  Believing that the Confederate states of the South had the power under the U.S. Constitution to secede from the Union, he opposed the war to reunite the nation.  Milligan became a leader of the secret Order of American Knights (formerly the Knights of the Golden Circle, and later the Sons of Liberty, and advocated violent revolution against the U.S. government.  U.S. Army forces arrested him at his home and tried him and other conspirators by military commission for disloyalty and conspiracy.  Found guilty, he was sentenced to death.  A habeas corpus appeal made its way from the federal circuit court in Indianapolis to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1866 ruled that the application of military tribunals to citizens when civil courts are open and operating was unconstitutional.  See \"Ex parte Milligan\" 71 U.S. (4 Wall. ) 2 (1866) .  Following the Court's ruling on April 3, 1866, Milligan and the others were released from custody.  He returned home and practiced law in Huntington, Indiana, where he later filed a civil suit claiming damages for the military arrest and trial.  On May 30, 1871, the jury found in Milligan's favor, but federal and state statutes limited the award for damages to five dollars plus court costs.

It concerned section 41 of the Australian Constitution, and the question of whether four people eligible to vote in New South Wales could be prevented from voting at the federal level by a federal law which closed registration to vote on the day that the writs of election were issued.  The court decided that they could, adopting a narrow interpretation of section 41, and therefore finding that there is no express constitutional right to vote in Australia. Ex parte Endo, or Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944), was a United States Supreme Court ex parte decision handed down on December 18, 1944, in which the Justices unanimously ruled that the U.S. government could not continue to detain a citizen who was \"concededly loyal\" to the United States.  Although the Court did not touch on the constitutionality of the exclusion of people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast—which they had found not to violate citizen rights in their \"Korematsu v. United States\" decision on the same date—the Endo ruling nonetheless led to the reopening of the West Coast to Japanese Americans after their incarceration in camps across the U.S. interior during World War II. The Marshall Court (1801–1835) heard forty-one criminal law cases, slightly more than one per year.  Among such cases are \"United States v. Simms\" (1803), \"United States v. More\" (1805), \"Ex parte Bollman\" (1807), \"United States v. Hudson\" (1812), \"Cohens v. Virginia\" (1821), \"United States v. Perez\" (1824), \"Worcester v. Georgia\" (1832), and \"United States v. Wilson\" (1833). Ex Parte Bowman 61 USPQ 2d 1669 (Bd.  Pat.  App.  & Int.  2001) was a decision by the U.S. Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences which asserted that in order to be patent-eligible, a process had to involve or promote the technological arts.  This decision was overruled by the Board's subsequent \"Ex Parte Lundgren\" decision, but the Board's and then the Federal Circuit's In re Bilski opinion then superseded \"Lundgren\".  \"In re Bilski\", however, rejects use of \"not in the technological arts\" as a basis for a rejection, although it seems to accept the concept when differently named.  \"Bilski\" is now pending on writ of certiorari. The Chase Court (1864–1873) issued thirty-five opinions in criminal cases over nine years, at a significantly higher rate than the Marshall Court or Taney Court before it.  Notable such cases include \"Ex parte Milligan\" (1866), \"Pervear v. Massachusetts\" (1866), \"Ex parte McCardle\" (1867, 1869), \"Ex parte Yerger\" (1868), and \"United States v. Kirby\" (1868).", "com_question": "Which Justice delivered the majority opinion in Ex parte Milligan?

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_476", "context": "Roman Emperors were rulers of the Roman Empire, wielding power over its citizens and military.  The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia.  Under the republic, regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \"Senate and People of Rome\".  Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates – of whom the consuls were the most powerful.  The republic ended, and the emperors were created, when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates.  Augustus, the first emperor, was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule, taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power \"Princeps Senatus\" (the first man of the senate).  This style of government lasted for 300 years, and is thus called the \"Principate\" era.  The modern word 'emperor' derives from the title \"imperator\", which was granted by an army to a successful general; during the initial phase of the empire, it still had to be earned by the 'Princeps'.  The term emperor is a modern construction, used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army (on whose support the ruler's power depended), and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire. The writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero constitute one of the most famous bodies of historical and philosophical work in all of classical antiquity.  Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist, philosopher, and Roman constitutionalist, lived from 106 to 43 BC.  He was a Roman senator and consul (chief-magistrate) who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.  A contemporary of Julius Caesar, Cicero is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. The personal life of Marcus Tullius Cicero provided the underpinnings of one of the most significant politicians of the Roman Republic.  Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist, philosopher, and Roman constitutionalist, played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.  A contemporary of Julius Caesar, Cicero is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. The technology history of the Roman military covers the development of and application of technologies for use in the armies and navies of Rome from the Roman Republic to the fall of the Western Roman Empire.  The rise of Hellenism and the Roman Republic are generally seen as signalling the end of the Iron Age in the Mediterranean.  Roman iron-working was enhanced by a process known as carburization.  The Romans used the better properties in their armaments, and the 1,300 years of Roman military technology saw radical changes.  The Roman armies of the early empire were much better equipped than early republican armies.  Metals used for arms and armor primarily included iron, bronze, and brass.  For construction, the army used wood, earth, and stone.  The later use of concrete in architecture was widely mirrored in Roman military technology, especially in the application of a military workforce to civilian construction projects. Gaius Julius Caesar is a historical figure who features as a character in the HBO/BBC2 \"Rome (TV series)\", played by Irish actor Ciarán Hinds.  The real Julius Caesar was a Roman general who seized control of the Roman government in 45 BC and laid the political foundations for the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. This list of ancient Roman collegia (Latin singular collegium, meaning \"joined together\"; English for \"college\") denotes a subset of professional, religious, and burial associations that existed during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.  The other major legal form of Roman associations were political clubs, known as \"sodalitates\".  The collegia played a critical sociological role in organizing Roman society, particularly among slaves and the other lower classes.  Concurrently, much of the history of collegia were left unrecorded by Roman historians, as the aristocratic authors of the time were predominantly uninterested in chronicling the labor union activities, cult worshiping rituals, and general social practices of the working classes.  Exceptions to this rule existed, such as the notable and prestigious Collegium Pistorum, the college of bakers, which received wealth, political status in the Roman Senate, and some historical attention in ancient Rome.  The most powerful of these professional collegia often had considerable political influence, including over legislation and magistrate appointments.  This professional class of collegia were modeled in the same manner as a public corporation.  However, under Roman law, collegia never were granted the same legal rights of personhood as modern corporations. The history of the Constitution of the Roman Republic is a study of the ancient Roman Republic that traces the progression of Roman political development from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the founding of the Roman Empire in 27 BC.  The constitutional history of the Roman Republic can be divided into five phases.  The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Republic, and thus created the Roman Empire, in 27 BC.  Throughout the history of the republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the struggle between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens. Marcus Antonius (Latin: ; January 14, 83 BC – August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire. The political career of Marcus Tullius Cicero began in 75 BC with his election to the office of quaestor, and ended in 43 BC, when he was assassinated upon the orders of Mark Antony.  Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist, philosopher, and Roman constitutionalist, reached the height of Roman power, the Consulship, and played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.  A contemporary of Julius Caesar, Cicero is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. Gaius Julius Caesar (Latin: CAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR, ] , born: 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), usually called Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

The party's goal was to present a united anti-war platform for the coming election. The Citizens Party of the United States (Citizens Party) is a political party in the United States.  Founded by Michael Thompson in Wayne, Pennsylvania in 2004 as the New American Independent Party (NAIP), the first meeting took place in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania on the day of the general election in 2004.  The New American Independent Party changed its name to the Citizens Party in January 2011.  The transition to the Citizens Party lasted several months. The New American Story is a book written by former United States Senator and 2000 presidential hopeful, Bill Bradley, and first published on March 27, 2007.  The book offers workable solutions to the old American stories about economy, oil, entitlements, and party politics. The Headless Nun is a ghost story associated with French Fort Cove in Nordin, now the City of Miramichi, New Brunswick. The National Coalition Party (Spanish: \"Partido de Concertación Nacional\" , PCN) is a conservative political party in El Salvador.  Until 2011 it was known as the National Conciliation Party (Spanish: \"Partido de Conciliación Nacional\" , PCN).  It was the most powerful political party in the country during the 1960s and 1970s, and was closely associated with the Salvadoran military.  Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo, a candidate of the National Conciliation Party, was elected president in 1962, and the next three presidents were also from the party.  After the 1979 revolution the party declined in influence but continued to exist. The Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005.  The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child.  It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta.  The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.  In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada.  In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party.  The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005.  Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear.  If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again. The leader called Sisowath Thomico had instead of creating a political party chose to create on Friday 28 July 2006 what was called the \"Sampoan Sangkum Cheat Niyum (Alliance of the national community).\"  This was because when gathering some of the parties like the Khmer Unity Party and Angkor Empire Party etc.  Thomico said \"\"We decided not to form the party yet since the alliance is not yet complete\" which meant the Thomico was giving more time to other political parties to join the alliance and postpone the changing of the alliance into a new political party with a new name.  However, later on it was finally changed into a political party called Sangkum Jatiniyum Front Party that is recognized in October by the Interior Ministry of Cambodia. The Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), formerly known as Action Congress (AC), was a Nigerian political party formed via the merger of the Alliance for Democracy, the Justice Party, the Advance Congress of Democrats, and several other minor political parties in September 2006.  The party controlled Lagos.  It was regarded as a natural successor to the progressive politics more closely associated with the Action Group and Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo in the First and Second Republics respectively.  However, criticism of the party's more pragmatic and less ideological political outlook associated with AG and UPN, has made many argue it was less of a worthy political heir.  The Party had strong presence in the South West (5 Governors, 15 Senators and 6 State Houses), Mid-West (1 Governor) and North Central Regions (3 Senators).  Lagos, Edo, Ekiti, Kogi, Ondo, Bauchi, Plateau, Niger, Adamawa, Oyo and Osun states by far accounts for majority of the party's presence and discernible power base. The Socialist Party of Transylvania was a political party in Romania, active primarily in Transylvania.  Born out of the ethnic Romanian section of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP), it gradually attracted other socialist and social-democratic groups active in the Transleithanian lands of Austro-Hungary incorporated into the Kingdom of Romania after World War I.  Although initially it claimed, under the title Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat, the adherence of the MSZDP party sections in Banat, the latter, while maintaining close links with the Transylvania party, constituted themselves as a distinct political organization.  The party also actively sought the cooperation of the socialist parties active in other regions of Romania, working towards a unified political party of the working class.  Such plans were however soon thwarted by repression from the part of the Romanian authorities, as well as disagreements both inside the party and among the different socialist formations of Romania.  The disagreements were further aggravated by the request of the Third International that the leaders of the party that had collaborated with the Romanian National Party be excluded from the merger, and eventually resulted in the split between the reformist social-democrats and the revolutionary-minded communists.  While the former decided to retire from unification talks and re-establish an independent Transyvanian party, the latter joined the majority of Socialist Party of Romania (PSR) to create the Communist Party of Romania in May 1921.  The social-democratic faction would late join the PSR members that disagreed with the new orientation of their party, founding the Romanian Social Democratic Party in 1927. The Palang Dharma Party (Thai: พรรคพลังธรรม , rtgs: Phak Phalang Tham ; translating to \"Power of Dharma\", or \"Moral Force\", PDP for short) was a Buddhist-inspired political party in Thailand founded by Chamlong Srimuang in 1988, associated with the Santi Asoke sect of Buddhism.  The Thai word \"tham\" can be used to refer both to \"morality\", and \"dharma\", the teachings of Buddhism.  Phak Phalang Tham was a political party, not to be confused with its precursor, \"Ruam Phalang\" (\"Collective Force\"), the campaign group that backed Chamlong Srimuang in the 1985 Bangkok gubernatorial election.  To some extent, the PDP evolved into a political party from Ruam Phalang.

In 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls.  While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela Mónica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Cristóbal.  Subsequent arrests and killings of student protestors spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders.  The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protestors and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government.  Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting.  By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections as well as the incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum.  On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the \"largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela\".  Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating.  After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediate dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017.  Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew \"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\".  The protests are considered to be the Mother of all Protests. The Amish is a 2012 documentary film created by PBS as an episode of American Experience.

This is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.  By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene.  New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed.  In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques.  Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement.  From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock.  Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history. Cross Canadian Ragweed was an American southern rock/alternative country band formed in Yukon, Oklahoma in 1994.  The band consisted of Cody Canada (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), Randy Ragsdale (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar).  From 1994-2010, the group released 6 studio albums and 3 live albums.  The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the country rock music scene in both Oklahoma and Texas.  After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010. Rock music has been a part of the music of Ireland since the 1960s, when the British Invasion brought British blues, psychedelic rock and other styles to the island.  The Irish music scene in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was dominated by the unique Irish phenomenon of the 'Showbands' which were groups of professional performers who played at dancehalls and clubs across the country putting on a professional 'show' and playing all the American and British hits of the era.  From the mid-1970s onwards Rock music in Ireland has been very similar to Rock music in Britain. Arabic Rock describes a wide variety of forms of music made in the Arab World.  Although no major Arabic Rock bands existed before the year 2000, the alternative music scene boomed afterwards with the creation of popular bands such as: Mashrou' Leila of Lebanon; JadaL, Akher Zapheer, El Morabba3, and Autostrad of Jordan; Massar Egbari, Kayan and Malaaz of Egypt; Tanjaret Daghet, and Khebez Dawle of Syria (the latter are currently based in Germany).  Many Arab musicians have adopted musical forms foreign to Arab culture like rock music and have attempted to arabize them. Serbian rock is the rock music scene of Serbia.  During the 1960s, 1970s and the 1980s, while Serbia was a constituent republic of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbian rock scene was a part of the SFR Yugoslav rock scene.

This composer and interpreter had a great impact on the Portuguese music scene with the record, \"Ar de Rock\" (April 1980), which influences were Eric Clapton and B.B.King.  This album is considered a landmark of rock music in Portugal, and the one that started the boom of rock music in Portugal in the 1980s.

However, because of its strong association with Hitler, the isolated word usually comes with stigma and negative connotations when used with the meaning of \"leader\", especially in political contexts.  The word \"Führer\" has cognates in the Scandinavian languages, spelled \"fører\" in Danish and Norwegian and \"förare\" in Swedish, which have the same meaning and use as the German word, but without necessarily having political connotations. The Psychopathography of Adolf Hitler is an umbrella term for psychiatric (pathographic, psychobiographic) literature that deals with the hypothesis that the German Führer and Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) suffered from mental illness.  Both during his lifetime and after his death, Hitler has often been associated with mental disorders such as hysteria, megalomania or paranoid schizophrenia.  Psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who have diagnosed Hitler as having mental disturbance include well-known figures such as Walter C. Langer and Erich Fromm.  Other researchers, such as Fritz Redlich, have concluded that Hitler probably did not have these disorders. Adolf Hitler's directives or Führer's directives (\"Führerbefehle\") were instructions and strategic plans issued by Adolf Hitler himself.  They covered a wide range of subjects from detailed direction of military units in World War II to the governance of occupied territories and their populations.  Under the Nazi system, they were binding, to be followed to the letter and superseded any other law.  They should not be confused with the Führer's orders, issued late in the war, which were more precise and low-level and could be written or oral.  They were as binding as the more general directives. The Führer Grenadier Brigade (formerly Führer Grenadier Battalion later Führer Grenadier Division) was an élite German Army combat unit which saw action during World War II.  The Führer Grenadier Brigade is sometimes mistakenly perceived as being a part of the Waffen-SS, whereas it was actually an Army unit and technically assigned to the Großdeutschland Division.  This misconception comes from its original duty of guarding Adolf Hitler's East Prussian Wolfsschanze Headquarters, a task which sounded similar to the original one of Waffen-SS 1.  Panzer Division \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\", which in turn stemmed from the Führer's original bodyguard corps.  Fighting on both the Eastern and Western Fronts, the brigade surrendered to U.S. forces in Austria in 1945. Karlheinz Pintsch (1909 -?)  was the long serving senior adjutant to Rudolf Hess who was the Deputy Führer to Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.  It fell to him to report Hess's illegal May 1941 flight to Scotland to Hitler and his recollections and notes have been the subject of debate by historians. The personal standard of Adolf Hitler was designed after Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934.  Adolf Hitler abolished the title \"Reichspräsident\" and in its place instituted the title of \"Führer\" which henceforth could only be used when referring to him personally.  Hindenburg used a personal standard consisting of a black eagle on a square gold background edged by a border of black, white and red bands.  Hitler decided on 19 August 1934 to adopt a personal standard for himself, which was called \"Personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Chancellor of the German Nation\".  As he was also Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces it was somewhat later known as \"The personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces\" (German: \"Standarte des Führers und Obersten Befehlshabers der Wehrmacht\"). The military career of Adolf Hitler can be divided into two distinct portions of Adolf Hitler's life.  Mainly, the period during World War I when Hitler served as a \"Gefreiter\" (lance corporal) in the Bavarian Army, and the era of World War II when Hitler served as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) through his position as Führer of Nazi Germany. Henry Victor Dicks (1900 – 12 July 1977) was a British psychiatrist.  He drew on his wartime experiences, which included the medical care of Rudolf Hess, to develop views on authoritarian personality and the collective psychopathology of authoritarian regimes. The Leibstandarte SS \"Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH) was founded in September 1933 as Adolf Hitler's personal Bodyguard formation.  It was given the title \"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\" (LAH) in November, 1933.  On 13 April 1934, by order of Himmler, the regiment became known as the \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH).  In 1939 the LSSAH became a separate unit of the Waffen-SS aside the SS-TV and the SS-VT.", "com_question": "Who was appointed Deputy Führer to Adolf Hitler in 1933, and what was his fate afterward?", "com_reference": "Rudolf Walter Richard Hess was appointed Deputy Führer to Adolf Hitler in 1933.

It was nominated for 'Best Reggae Album' in the Grammy Awards. Pamona (often referred to as Poso, Bare'e, or To Pamona) people inhabits almost the entire Poso Regency, parts of Tojo Una-Una Regency and parts of North Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi; in fact there are some even in East Luwu Regency of South Sulawesi, whereas a small remainder lives in other parts of Indonesia.  The ancestors of the Pamona people originally came from the land of Salu Moge (East Luwu Regency, South Sulawesi) because they were once from the mountains which is far from the central governance thus they were brought down by Macoa Bawalipu of Wotu, East Luwu Regency to be nearer to the central governance, which is the surrounding region of Mangkutana (East Luwu Regency).  But it was until a revolt by the Darul Islam (Indonesia) rebellion broke out that they spread to Central Sulawesi and to other regions.  If there are Pamona people in certain regions, then it is common that a \"Rukun Poso\" (Poso community association) is formed there, which serves as a means of a group of people from a common ethnic background to engage in various activities within the region.  Almost all of the Pamona people practices Christianity.  Christianity came into the region about 100 years ago and until today it is widely accepted as the religion of the people.  Today, all churches of common denomination are grouped under the Central Sulawesi Christian Church headquartered in Tentena, Poso Regency, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.  A large part of the common folk uses Pamona language and Bahasa Indonesia language that is mixed with the local slang.  The Pamona people are usually farmers, government officials, pastors, entrepreneurs and so on. Lion in the Morning is the debut album by British Jamaican reggae musician Julian Marley, released in 1996 on Lightyear Entertainment. The Batı Çalışma Grubu (BÇG; English: West Study Group or West Working Group ) was an alleged clandestine grouping within the Turkish military said to be linked to the Ergenekon organization.  It was allegedly set up in 1997 by General Çevik Bir (then deputy-chief of the General Staff of the Republic of Turkey) as part of the process relating to the 1997 military memorandum (the \"post-modern coup\"), and active until at least May 2009.  The primary activity of the group appears to have been classifying politicians, military personnel, journalists and others according to ethnic background, religious affiliation and political leanings, and to monitor the activity of those considered a potential danger to secularism in Turkey.  This included monitoring some religious communities outside Turkey.  It has been claimed that in 1997 BÇG had records on 6 million people, and offices in the Higher Education Board (YÖK) as well as in each branch of the military. A Time & Place is the second studio album by reggae artist Julian Marley, released in 2003 on Lightyear Entertainment. Multicultural media in Canada also referred to as “ethnic media” or “third media” (as it does not use either French or English language) is media, which responds to the needs of ethnic minorities of Canada.  The objective of multicultural media in Canada is to create a voice for a community of a particular ethnic background, challenge social injustices, and foster cultural pride for minority and immigrant Canadians.  Ethnic media do not always target new immigrants, though much of this particular media works to eliminate feelings of isolation in the dominant culture.  Multicultural media also services Canadian-born individuals of a visible minority as well as diasporic ethnicities.  Ultimately, multicultural media in Canada, whether it is delivered in English, French or the respective language of the culture, is to contribute to the cultural maintenance and ethnic cohesion of the culture in question but also help members of minorities to integrate into larger Canadian society.  The third-language media are especially important for new immigrants, as they are usually the main source of information for those who have yet to become proficient in one of the official languages.  Thus, third-language media provide crucial information on education, training, and job seeking for these immigrants. Demographics of the province of Prince Edward Island, Canada.  According to the 2011 National Household Survey, the largest ethnic group consists of people of Scottish descent (39.2%), followed by English (31.1%), Irish (30.4%), French (21.1%), German (5.2%), and Dutch (3.1%) descent.  Prince Edward Island is mostly a white community and there are few visible minorities.  Chinese people are the largest visible minority group of Prince Edward Island, comprising 1.3% of the province's population.  Almost half of respondents identified their ethnicity as \"Canadian.\"  Most readers will not know that Prince Edward Island is by a strong margin the most Celtic and specifically the most Scottish province in Canada (often thought to be Nova Scotia) and perhaps the most Scottish place (ethnically) in the world, outside Scotland.  38% of islanders claim Scottish ancestry, but this is an underestimate and it is thought that almost 50% of islanders have Scottish roots.  When combined with Irish and Welsh, almost 80% of islanders are of some Celtic stock, albeit most families have resided in PEI for at least two centuries.  Few places outside Europe can claim such a homogenous Celtic ethnic background.  Certainly, in a North American context, the only other jurisdiction with such a high percentage of British Isles heritage would be Newfoundland. Volodymyr Mykhailovych Kubiyovych, also spelled \"Kubiiovych\" or \"Kubijovyč\" (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Миха́йлович Кубійо́вич ; 23 September 1900, Nowy Sącz, Austrian Galicia – 2 November 1985, Paris, France) was a Ukrainian geographer with a specialty in demography, a cartographer, an encyclopedist, politician, and statesman.  Of mixed Ukrainian and Polish ethnic background, he was an important intellectual supporting the Ukrainian national movement in inter-war Poland, and his scholarly works from this period dealt with the Ukrainian ethnic presence in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, and with the geographical boundaries of ethnographic Ukraine. Hunky is an ethnic slur used in the United States to refer to a laborer from Central Europe.  It originated in the coal regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, where Poles and other immigrants from Central Europe (Hungarians (Magyar), Rusyns, Slovaks) came to perform hard manual labor on the mines.  They were called \"hunkies\" by the American public, which lumped them together into a category of Slavic immigrants, irrespective of their individual ethnic background.  The use of the term as an ethnic slur has fallen into disuse, but the term \"hunky\" and the public image associated with it has historic relevance in the perception of Slavic immigrants in the United States.  There is some usage of the term in other forms; for example, it is used to describe any mill worker in regions of Pennsylvania, as part of the term \"Mill Hunky\".

In 1912, Goodpasture graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with an M.D. degree.  There, under professors William H. Welch and George H. Whipple, he was subsequently appointed a Rockefeller Fellow in pathology; he held this position from 1912 to 1915.  Thereafter, Goodpasture joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School, as an attending pathologist at the Penter Bent Brigham Hospital and assistant professor of pathology in Boston.  During that time, Goodpasture took a two-year leave of absence to serve during World War I as a medical officer in the United States Navy.  In 1919, he undertook a pathological study of the then-ongoing influenza pandemic.  In doing so, he identified a patient whose infection was followed by a peculiar illness that featured hemoptysis and acute glomerulonephritis.  That condition, now known as Goodpasture syndrome, is currently recognized as an immunologically mediated disease caused by autoantibodies that bind to pulmonary-alveolar, as well as glomerular-capillary, basement membranes.  After leaving Harvard in 1921, Goodpasture worked at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine in Manila.  From 1922 to 1924, he was the director of William H. Singer Memorial Laboratories, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  In 1924, Goodpasture was invited to return to Vanderbilt as professor and chairman of the Department of Pathology, the School of Medicine having been recently reorganized.

Released on June 25, 1973 by Atlantic Records, It was the first Atlantic album by Aretha to miss the Top 25 of the album chart.  (It peaked at #30.)  This album was originally planned to be a straight jazz album with songs like \"Moody's Mood\" and \"Just Right Tonight\", but producers Franklin and Quincy Jones took a detour and produced songs like \"Mister Spain\" and the title cut.  Critics dismissed this album as Aretha's worst LP up until that point.  The album is however considered a classic to some of Aretha's die-hard fans.  A high point was the #1 R&B and Top 20 Pop single \"Angel\" written by Aretha's younger sister, Carolyn Franklin, as well as her cover of \"Somewhere\" which features Franklin on piano and Phil Woods on alto sax.  This recording was reissued on compact disc through Rhino Records in the 1990s.  The song \"Master Of Eyes\" was included as the 10th track on the reissue.

Franklin also included a live recording on the album \"Aretha in Paris\" in 1968.  Versions have also been performed and recorded by King herself, Mary J. Blige, Celine Dion, and many others.

At a time when Nintendo's GameCube console had failed to capture market share, Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off third-party developer support.  Capcom USA followed up with confirmation that they would be exclusive to the GameCube.  The five games were \"P.N.03\", a futuristic third-person shooter; \"Viewtiful Joe\", a side-scrolling action-platformer; \"Dead Phoenix\", a shoot 'em up; \"Resident Evil 4\", a survival horror third-person shooter; and \"Killer7\", an action-adventure game with first-person shooter elements.  Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by \"Resident Evil\" director Shinji Mikami and, except \"Killer7\", developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4.  Capcom USA later clarified that only \"Resident Evil 4\" was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company. Leon Scott Kennedy (レオン・スコット・ケネディ , Reon Sukotto Kenedi ) is a fictional character in the \"Resident Evil\" horror media franchise by Capcom.  He debuted as one of the two playable protagonists of the video game \"Resident Evil 2\".

{"ID": "hotpot_qa_493", "context": "Herb Curtis (born 1949) is a Canadian novelist and humorist who writes about and has long lived in New Brunswick.  He is best known for writing the Brennen Siding Trilogy, three connected novels set in the fictional community of Brennen Siding, New Brunswick (loosely based on Kennan Siding, New Brunswick).  The trilogy consists of the novels \"The Americans are Coming\", \"The Last Tasmanian\" and \"The Lone Angler\".  The most critically acclaimed of the series is \"The Last Tasmanian\" which won the 1992 Thomas Head Raddall Award and was nominated for the Commonwealth Prize.  In 1999, Curtis was nominated for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour for his collection of humorous stories, \"Luther Corhern's Salmon Camp Chronicles\". Ron Terpening (born Ronnie Harold Terpening on May 3, 1946) is an American writer, professor of Italian, and editor.  Though he started his writing career as an author of young-adult fiction, where the father/son conflict is a major theme, he is best known for his later novels of suspense, most of which are set, at least in part, in Italy, reflecting his academic background as a scholar of Italian culture.  His thriller \"League of Shadows\", for example, deals with the Fascist Era in Italy and its aftermath in the contemporary world.  A later international thriller, \"Nine Days in October\", came out of the author’s course research on the forces of order and disorder in contemporary Italy and follows a band of criminals and ex-terrorists as they attempt to carry out an assassination plot.  All of his novels, including \"Storm Track\" and \"Tropic of Fear\", the latter set in Paraguay, are noted for their strong sense of place.  In most of his novels, his protagonist is usually a common man placed in a situation where powerful forces are arrayed against him. William Scott Home (born January 2, 1940) is the pen name (and, later, legal name) of an American author, poet and biologist principally known for writing horror and dark fantasy.  Best known for a short story that appeared in 1978 in \"The Year’s Best Horror Stories\" (along with Stephen King’s “Children of the Corn”, which also made the cut that year), Home was most prolific during the 1970s and 80s when his poetry and fiction was published in a wide range of media.  Part of a circle of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror writers that paid homage to M. P. Shiel and H. P. Lovecraft, Home is considered by many to be a unique talent in his own right.  His range of styles and control of language and suspense is well-demonstrated in his published collection: \"Hollow Faces, Merciless Moons\".  While he has not published much since the 1980s, Home is still writing and currently lives in the Dyea Valley, west of Skagway, Alaska. Joseph Laurent (1839-1917) was chief of the Abenaki village of Odanak in Quebec, Canada, from 1880 to 1892.  He was a teacher and leader in his Algonquian community, and the Odanak Nation throughout his life.  Laurent, also known as Sozap Lolô, is best known for the publication of his book \"New Familiar Abenakis and English Dialogues.\"  The book is a dictionary that translates Abenaki to English, and was the first of its kind.  The Algonquian-speaking nation was verbal, and in need of being preserved in writing.  The structure of the dictionary is what widely sets it apart from others.  His translations are set up as a journey through their land as opposed to a standard list.  He takes the reader on a trip from Quebec and throughout New England through linguistics and language education.  Despite Laurent's upbringing of speaking fluent Abenaki and French, he not only created a dictionary to teach English to Abenaki people, he more importantly created the substantial text in an effort to preserve the Abenaki language and culture.  The Abenaki language was oral, and little to no written documents had been recorded.  \"New Familiar Abenakis and English Dialogues\" was vital in taking the number of a hundred-plus speakers to the rest of the Abenaki population as they continued to be a part of an English-speaking world, and it is still widely used today.  Among others, the Abenaki linguist Jesse Bruchac has used the work of Laurent in his own work on language revitalization. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a 2012 American coming-of-age drama film.

Two or three years after the release of film, Chbosky began to speak more openly concerning the mental health care aspects of the film which were of significance to him in the original writing of the book and the production of the film as he conceived it.  This is one of the three films from John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon and Russell Smith's Mr. Mudd Productions that feature struggling teenagers; the other two are \"Ghost World\" and \"Juno\".

All five of the men were killed by the tribe.  The book is Elliot's first book, and arguably her most well known work. Home was an American daytime television program hosted by Arlene Francis.  Intended for an audience of women, it debuted in 1954 as one of NBC's three major non-primetime shows.  While the other two shows—\"Today\" and \"Tonight\"—are still being produced 60 years later, Home was cancelled in 1957. Operation Auca was an attempt by five Evangelical Christian missionaries from the United States to bring Christianity to the Huaorani people of the rain forest of Ecuador.  The Huaorani, also known by the pejorative Aucas (a modification of \"awqa\", the Quechua word for \"savages\"), were an isolated tribe known for their violence, against both their own people and outsiders who entered their territory.  With the intention of being the first Christians to evangelize the previously uncontacted Huaorani, the missionaries began making regular flights over Huaorani settlements in September 1955, dropping gifts, which were reciprocated.  After several months of exchanging gifts, on January 3, 1956, the missionaries established a camp at \"Palm Beach\", a sandbar along the Curaray River, a few kilometers from Huaorani settlements.  Their efforts came to an end on January 8, 1956, when all five—Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian—were attacked and speared by a group of Huaorani warriors.  The news of their deaths was broadcast around the world, and \"Life\" magazine covered the event with a photo essay.", "com_question": "What were Arlene Francis' featured roles?

Behavior that appears to be altruistic can be understood as being motivated by the desire to reinforce that belief, a clearly self-interested motivation.", "com_question": "What motivates altruistic behavior? How does it relate to self-esteem? Can altruism be purely selfless?", "com_reference": "The passage suggests that altruistic behavior is not truly selfless but is influenced by self-interest and the desire to boost one's self-esteem. The motivation behind altruistic behavior is explained as a way to enhance one's self-perceived usefulness and importance. The passage implies that individuals engage in seemingly altruistic acts to reinforce their belief in their own value, which is essential for maintaining self-esteem.\n\nThe relation between altruistic behavior and self-esteem presented in the passage indicates that individuals may engage in acts of apparent altruism not solely for the benefit of others but also to fulfill their own psychological need for feelings of worth and significance. Therefore, altruism, as described in the passage, is seen as rooted in a form of self-interest related to maintaining self-esteem rather than being entirely selfless.\n\nRegarding the purity of altruism, the passage suggests that altruistic behavior is inherently motivated by self-interest as a means to bolster self-esteem. This perspective challenges the notion of pure selflessness in altruistic acts and implies that altruism is intertwined with personal motivations and feelings of self-worth. In this context, the passage suggests that pure selflessness may not exist as altruistic behavior is ultimately connected to individuals' desire to feel valued and needed.\n\nIn summary, the passage posits that altruistic behavior is influenced by self-interest driven by the desire to reinforce one's sense of self-worth and importance. This perspective questions the notion of pure selflessness in altruism and highlights the complex interplay between altruistic acts, personal motivations, and self-esteem."}

It is a mighty people that $\\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety!

Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \\mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence.

{"ID": "agi_eval_559", "context": "We may think we’re a culture that gets rid of our worn technology at the first sight of something shiny and new, but a new study shows that we keep using our old devices (装置) well after they go out of style. That’s bad news for the environment – and our wallets – as these outdated devices consume much more energy than the newer ones that do the same things.To figure out how much power these devices are using, Callie Babbitt and her colleagues at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York tracked the environmental costs for each product throughout its life – from when its minerals are mined to when we stop using the device. This method provided a readout for how home energy use has evolved since the early 1990s. Devices were grouped by generation. Desktop computers, basic mobile phones, and box-set TVs defined 1992. Digital cameras arrived on the scene in 1997. And MP3 players, smart phones, and LCD TVs entered homes in 2002, before tablets and e-readers showed up in 2007.As we accumulated more devices, however, we didn’t throw out our old ones. “The living-room television is replaced and gets planted in the kids’ room, and suddenly one day, you have a TV in every room of the house,” said one researcher. The average number of electronic devices rose from four per household in 1992 to 13 in 2007. We’re not just keeping these old devices – we continue to use them. According to the analysis of Babbitt’s team, old desktop monitors and box TVs with cathode ray tubes are the worst devices with their energy consumption and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions (排放) more than doubling during the 1992 to 2007 window.So what’s the solution (解决方案)? The team’s data only went up to 2007, but the researchers also explored what would happen if consumers replaced old products with new electronics that serve more than one function, such as a tablet for word processing and TV viewing.

{"ID": "agi_eval_567", "context": "To understand John Rawls's theory of justice, one first needs to grasp what he was reacting against. The dominant approach in pre-Rawls political philosophy was utilitarianism, which emphasized maximizing the fulfillment of peopled preferences. At first sight, utilitarianism seems plausible-what else should we do but try to achieve the most satisfaction possible for the greatest number of people?-but the theory has some odd consequences. Suppose executing an innocent person will appease a mob, and that doing so will therefore increase total satisfaction. Incredibly, a utilitarian would have to endorse the execution. Rawls accordingly complains that, in the utilitarian view, there is no reason \"why the violation of the liberty of a few might not be made right by the greater good shared by many.\" If we reject utilitarianism and its view about the aim of the good life, how can we know what justice requires? Rawls offers an ingenious answer. He asserts that even if people do not agree on the aim of the good life, they can accept a fair procedure for settling what the principles of justice should be. This is key to Rawls's theory: Whatever arises from a fair procedure is just. But what is a fair procedure? Rawls again has a clever approach, beginning with his famous veil of ignorance. Suppose five children have to divide a cake among themselves. One child cuts the cake but does not know who will get which shares. The child is likely to divide the cake into equal shares to avoid the possibility of receiving the smallest share, an arrangement that the others will also admit to be fair. By denying the child information that would bias the result, a fair outcome can be achieved. Rawls generalizes the point of this example of the veil of ignorance. His thought experiment features a situation, which he calls the original position, in which people are self-interested but do not know their own station in life, abilities, tastes, or even gender. Under the limits of this ignorance, individuals motivated by self-interest endeavor to arrive at a solution in which they will not lose, because nobody loses. The result will be a just arrangement. Rawls thinks that people, regardless of their plan of life,want certain \"primary goods.\" These include rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, and income and wealth. Without these primary goods, people cannot accomplish their goals, whatever they may be. Hence, any individual in the original position will agree that everyone should get at least a minimum amount of these primary goods. Unfortunately, this is an inherently redistributionist idea, since the primary goods are not natural properties of human beings. If someone lacks a primary good, it must be provided, at the expense of others if necessary.", "com_question": "What is Rawls's fair procedure called? How does the veil of ignorance work in Rawls's theory? What are the primary goods Rawls mentions?", "com_reference": "Rawls's fair procedure is called the original position. The veil of ignorance works in Rawls's theory by placing individuals in a hypothetical scenario where they are unaware of their own station in life, abilities, tastes, or gender. This ignorance helps individuals make decisions unbiased by self-interest, leading to a fair outcome where nobody loses. The primary goods Rawls mentions include rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, and income and wealth. These goods are essential for individuals to pursue their goals and objectives, regardless of their differing life plans."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_573", "context": "\\section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.", "com_question": "What does Tocqueville suggest about gender roles in society?

Tocqueville argues that such an attempt would only result in the degradation of both sexes, leading to weak men and disorderly women.\n\nOn the other hand, Tocqueville notes that Americans understand democratic equality between the sexes differently. He observes that Americans recognize the natural differences in the physical and moral constitution of men and women, leading them to believe that each should have distinct roles and duties.

{"ID": "agi_eval_594", "context": "Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.", "com_question": "What factors influence deliberate crimes? How can penalties and economic opportunities deter crime effectively?", "com_reference": "Factors that influence deliberate crimes include societal norms and institutions, individual choice, economic incentives, and disincentives. According to the passage, one side of the debate suggests that deliberate crimes are influenced by societal norms and institutions, while the other side argues that they are primarily the result of individual choice. The economic principle of utility maximization posits that rational individuals will choose actions that maximize their expected overall satisfaction, which includes weighing the utilities of possible outcomes and their likelihood of occurring.\n\nPenalties and economic opportunities can deter crime effectively by impacting the expected utility calculation of individuals considering criminal activities. Increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with stronger law enforcement, can raise the cost and decrease the expected utility of committing a crime. On the other hand, improving economic opportunities for individuals can increase the expected utility from lawful activities, making criminal behavior less appealing.\n\nThe passage suggests that both strategies can complement each other in deterring deliberate crimes. Strengthening law enforcement and increasing penalties can raise the cost and decrease the expected utility of crime, while enhancing economic opportunities can increase the expected utility of lawful activities. By addressing both individual choice and societal influences, a more comprehensive approach to crime deterrence can be developed."}

By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.Gray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.The disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations — major food sources (来源) for the wolf — grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.As early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red foxes have made a comeback.

{"ID": "agi_eval_616", "context": "\"Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect.\" This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.", "com_question": "What influenced Beethoven's popularity? When did Schoenberg introduce the 12-tone technique? What distinguishes Schoenberg's music?", "com_reference": "Beethoven's popularity was influenced by the invention of the phonograph, which allowed for repeated listening and a deeper understanding of his more challenging works.

{"ID": "agi_eval_621", "context": "Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented \"noses\" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.", "com_question": "What parallels exist between painting and perfumery? Are art professionals exploring fragrances like paintings? How do perfumers create their scents?", "com_reference": "The passage highlights several parallels between painting and perfumery. Both painters and perfumers use a combination of natural and synthetic elements to create their works of art. Painters mix pigments with oils and resins, similar to how perfumers carefully formulate chemical compounds to create scents. Both art forms involve a meticulous process of combining various elements to achieve a desired result.\n\nWhile art professionals such as curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics are serious about exploring various branches of art like literature, architecture, and music, the passage suggests that they may not give the same level of attention to fragrances as they do to oil paintings. The author notes that there seems to be a lack of interest among curators in exploring perfumes as works of art, such as the 1930 masterpiece Joy Parfum by Henri Almeras.\n\nPerfumers create their scents by experimenting with complex configurations of olfactory elements. Similar to how painters slowly build up layers of paint to create a picture, perfumers combine different scents that evolve over time as they evaporate at different rates on the skin. By skillfully combining various scents, perfumers create an olfactory experience that can evoke a range of emotions and memories, much like a painter or composer can through their art.\n\nOverall, the passage suggests that there are indeed parallels between painting and perfumery, but the latter may not receive as much attention and recognition in the art world as it deserves."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_635", "context": "Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.", "com_question": "What evidence supports the impact hypothesis? Why is radiocarbon dating considered perilous? Would Clovis artifacts indicate an extraterrestrial event?", "com_reference": "The evidence supporting the impact hypothesis includes deposits of the element iridium, microscopic diamonds (nanodiamonds), and magnetic particles found in deposits at sites dated to about 12,800 years ago.

The presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and magnetic sphere deposits is considered by impact proponents as a reliable indicator that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their disappearance.\n\nRadiocarbon dating is considered perilous according to Richard Firestone because it can be challenging and subject to errors. It is a complex process that relies on various factors such as calibration curves and assumptions about the past environment, which can introduce uncertainties in the dating results.\n\nWhile the presence of Clovis artifacts may not directly indicate an extraterrestrial event, impact proponents argue that the presence of these artifacts just under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and magnetic sphere deposits suggests a correlation between the artifacts and the impact event. They believe this provides further support for their hypothesis of an extraterrestrial impact causing the disappearance of the Clovis hunters and large mammals."}

In fact, Jack moved clear across the country in pursuit of the dreams.

Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy.

{"ID": "agi_eval_640", "context": "Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, \"We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been,\" and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a \"fruitful intermission\" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea.

{"ID": "agi_eval_667", "context": "Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted.

Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect", "com_question": "What is the reason for the rarity of mantle rocks in meteorites? How might differentiated iron bodies have survived in space?", "com_reference": "The rarity of mantle rocks in meteorites is attributed to several factors. One reason is that when asteroids break apart, rocky material near the surface is more easily removed through bombardment, while iron from the core tends to remain intact. Additionally, iron is much stronger than rock, allowing iron fragments to survive in space for a longer period compared to rocky fragments of the same size.\n\nDifferentiated iron bodies may have survived in space due to their composition and position within the asteroid. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated asteroid, which provides more protection from external forces. This means that the iron core remains as a single, intact piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Moreover, the strength of iron contributes to its resilience in the harsh conditions of space, allowing it to survive at least 10 times longer than rocky fragments of similar size."}

Some potential factors could include material defects, environmental conditions, wear and tear over time, poor maintenance, or even design flaws. Fractures may develop at locations where a combination of these factors weaken the structural integrity of the bridge.\n\nFractures not developing at high-stress points could be due to several reasons. It is possible that the high-stress points are well-supported or reinforced to prevent fractures. Additionally, the distribution of stress and load throughout the bridge structure might cause weaker spots to develop fractures as a result of cumulative damage over time. It's also possible that the high-stress points are designed to handle the stress effectively, directing it away from the weak spots prone to fractures.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of fractures on bridges is influenced by multiple factors, and fractures may occur at locations that are weakened by a combination of stress, wear, defects, and other environmental or structural factors, rather than solely at high-stress points."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_676", "context": "Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.", "com_question": "What historical event began the Great Migration?

{"ID": "agi_eval_677", "context": "It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is \"involuntary\" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as \"voluntary\" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary.\" Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.", "com_question": "What factors influence judgments about voluntary risk? Can decisions be classified as voluntary or involuntary? What should guide regulatory policy on risk?", "com_reference": "Factors that influence judgments about voluntary risk include whether the risk is incurred voluntarily, people's approval of the purpose for taking the risk, and the degree to which individuals have control over the risk.

Departures from this principle should not be based solely on the classification of risks as voluntary or involuntary, but rather on specific considerations that are relevant to the particular risk in question.

A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went \"against all previous experiences of nuclear physics,\" but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term \"nuclear fission,\" she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch.

The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional \"auxiliary\" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.", "com_question": "What is Popper's main contribution? How does he view positive and negative evidence? How do scientists deal with failed predictions?", "com_reference": "Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science concerns the power of negative evidence.

He believes that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also actively seeking evidence that could potentially disprove them. Popper's view is that a scientific theory must make testable predictions in order to be considered scientific.\n\nIn the context of failed predictions, scientists deal with them by examining the various auxiliary assumptions and premises that were used in deriving those predictions. When a prediction does not match observations, scientists consider multiple possible explanations, such as errors in the auxiliary assumptions or the need for additional theories or factors to be accounted for. In the case of the failed predictions of the orbit of Uranus and Mercury, astronomers revised their auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets, leading to the discovery of Neptune and the hypothesis of Vulcan. Ultimately, with the advancement of Einstein's theory of relativity, the calculations aligned with observations, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and the acceptance of Einstein's theory."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_727", "context": "At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. \"They jumped up like popcorn,\" he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. \"He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!\" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. \"I asked 35 him how it went,\" Ken recalled, \"and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' \" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the \"aha\" moment. \"The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,\" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. \"It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car,\" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)", "com_question": "What prompted Ken Dial to investigate baby game birds' flight?

{"ID": "agi_eval_735", "context": "The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, \"I didn't think you 70 were coming.\"Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.", "com_question": "What was the decoration at Alcazar Restaurant?

{"ID": "agi_eval_759", "context": "The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.", "com_question": "What genre did Roy Lichtenstein merge in his work? Did his paintings convey seriousness of theme? What was the main influence on Lichtenstein's art?", "com_reference": "Roy Lichtenstein merged the style of comic books with fine art in his work.

{"ID": "agi_eval_761", "context": "By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.", "com_question": "What discovery did Molina and Rowland make?

This process posed a significant threat to the ozone layer, as each chlorine atom could destroy a large number of ozone molecules.\n\nIn response to the environmental threat posed by CFCs, the international community took action in 1987 by signing the Montreal Protocol. This agreement aimed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs, in order to protect and restore the ozone layer. The Montreal Protocol led to significant changes in regulations and practices related to the use of CFCs and paved the way for the development of more environmentally friendly alternatives in various industries."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_776", "context": "Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of \"soft determinism.\" He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.", "com_question": "In which field do neuroscience findings impact? What does soft determinism suggest? What distinguishes free actions?", "com_reference": "The findings in neuroscience have a significant impact on the field of law, specifically challenging traditional concepts of responsibility and punishment. In this context, neuroscience findings suggest that behaviors are solely caused by brain operations, influencing our understanding of human decision-making and moral choices.\n\nSoft determinism, as suggested by Alfred J. Ayer and others, proposes that free will can coexist with determinism. This view acknowledges that actions can be determined by internal sources, such as one's own will, and distinguishes between free actions (not constrained by external sources) and constrained actions (caused by external forces). In the context of Ayer's theory, free actions are those that stem from internal sources, allowing for alternative choices, while constrained actions are those determined by external influences, leaving only one possible action."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_805", "context": "Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.", "com_question": "What physiological effects have researchers found from wine consumption?

{"ID": "agi_eval_806", "context": "Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.", "com_question": "What were the two colors of wampum?

Individuals that.are able to blend in to their surroundings and avoid.being eaten are able to survive longer, reproduce, and.thus increase their fitness (pass along their genes to.the next generation) compared to those who stand.out more. This may seem like a good strategy, and.fairly common in the animal kingdom, but who ever.heard of a plant doing the same thing?.In plants, the use of coloration or pigmentation as.a vital component of acquiring food (e.g.,.photosynthesis) or as a means of attracting.pollinators (e.g., flowers) has been well studied..However, variation in pigmentation as a means of.escaping predation has received little attention..Matthew Klooster from Harvard University and.colleagues empirically investigated whether the dried.bracts (specialized leaves) on a rare woodland plant,.Monotropsis odorata, might serve a similar purpose.as the stripes on a tiger or the grey coloration of the.wings of the peppered moth: namely, to hide..“Monotropsis odoratais a fascinating plant.species, as it relies exclusively upon mycorrhizal.fungus, that associates with its roots, for all of the.resources it needs to live,” notes Klooster. “Because.this plant no longer requires photosynthetic.pigmentation (i.e., green coloration) to produce its.own energy, it is free to adopt a broader range of.possibilities in coloration, much like fungi or.animals.”.Using a large population ofMonotropsis odorata,.Klooster and colleagues experimentally removed the.dried bracts that cover the 3- to 5-cm tall stems and.flower buds of these woodland plants. The bracts are.a brown color that resembles the leaf litter from.which the reproductive stems emerge and cover the.pinkish-purple colored buds and deep purple stems..When Klooster and colleagues measured the.reflectance pattern (the percentage of light reflected.at various wavelengths) of the different plant parts,.they indeed found that the bracts functioned as.camouflage, making the plant blend in with its.surroundings; the bract reflectance pattern closely.resembled that of the leaf litter, and both differed.from that of the reproductive stem and flowers.hidden underneath the bracts. Furthermore, they.experimentally demonstrated that this camouflage.actually worked to hide the plant from its predators.and increased its fitness. Individuals with intact.bracts suffered only a quarter of the herbivore.damage and produced a higher percentage of mature.fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed..“It has long been shown that animals use cryptic.coloration (camouflage) as a defense mechanism to.visually match a component of their natural.environment, which facilitates predator avoidance,”.Klooster said. “We have now experimentally.demonstrated that plants have evolved a similar.strategy to avoid their herbivores.”.Drying its bracts early to hide its reproductive.parts is a good strategy when the stems are exposed.to predators for long periods of time: all the other.species in the subfamily Monotropoideae have.colorful fleshy bracts and are reproductively active.for only a quarter of the length of time. Somewhat.paradoxically, however,Monotropsis odorataactually.relies on animals for pollination and seed dispersal..How does it accomplish this when it is disguised as.dead leaf material and is able to hide so well? The.authors hypothesize that the flowers emit highly.fragrant odors that serve to attract pollinators and.seed dispersal agents; indeed they observed bumble.bees finding and pollinating many reproductive.stems that were entirely hidden by the leaf litter itself.", "com_question": "How does Monotropsis odorata hide from predators? What is the role of fragrant odors in attracting pollinators?", "com_reference": "Monotropsis odorata hides from predators by using dried bracts that cover its stems and flower buds. The brown color of the bracts resembles leaf litter, allowing the plant to blend in with its surroundings and remain camouflaged.

Despite being disguised as dead leaf material, the plant relies on these fragrant odors to attract bumblebees, which then find and pollinate the reproductive stems that are hidden beneath the leaf litter. The fragrance acts as a signal to pollinators, guiding them to the hidden flowers for pollination and eventual seed dispersal."}
{"ID": "agi_eval_825", "context": "<a id=\"OLE_LINK3\"></a>During the rosy years of elementary school（小学）, I enjoyed sharing my dolls and jokes, which allowed me to keep my high social status.

They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.Popularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables’ plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there’s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.Enviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein’s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are “most likely to engage（从事）in dangerous and risky behavior.”In one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys（调查研究）. “We found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us.\"Dr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness — carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.In analyzing his and other research，Dr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. \"Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, ” he said.<a id=\"OLE_LINK3\"></a>32.

Thus, in contrast to personal or.private knowledge, which is generally left to.individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is.promoted even to those who might not think it.matters to them. In short, the circulation of public.knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded.as a public good which cannot be solely.demand-driven..The production, circulation, and reception.of public knowledge is a complex process. It is.generally accepted that public knowledge should.be authoritative, but there is not always.common agreement about what the public needs to.know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and.how authoritative reputations should be determined.and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The.Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely.regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative.agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied.the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of.authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the.opinions of others.” As part of the general process of.the transformation of authority whereby there has.been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional.sources of public knowledge, the demand has been.for all authority to make explicit the frames of value.which determine their decisions. Centres of news.production, as our focus groups show, have not been.exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps.some news journalists feel uneasy about this.renegotiation of their authority:.Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the.“most read” lists on their own and other websites.to work out which stories matter to readers and.viewers. And now the audience—which used to.know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of.journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our.credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008)..The result of democratising access to TV news.could be political disengagement by the majority.and a dumbing down through a popularity.contest of stories (online news editor, 2007)..Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,.they amount to more than straightforward.professional defensiveness. In their reference to an.audience “which used to know its place” and.conflation between democratisation and “dumbing.down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular.mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by.experts, immune from populist pressures; and.disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive.recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down.opportunities for popular involvement in the making.of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional.claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are.right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every.institutional level in contemporary society,.scepticism towards the epistemological authority of.expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed.by several of our focus group participants, that the.news media should be “informative rather than.authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to.“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their.slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient.information” from which “we would be able to form.opinions of our own.”.At stake here are two distinct conceptions of.authority. The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.", "com_question": "What examples define public knowledge?

{"ID": "agi_eval_841", "context": "\\section{Passage 1}\"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis,\" says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. \"Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth,\" Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. \"We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment,\" Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 \"standard of care treatment.\" That's going to take five years and $\\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.", "com_question": "What led to the discovery of teixobactin? Which pathogens was teixobactin effective against?

{"ID": "agi_eval_847", "context": "The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.", "com_question": "What are the primary substances in plants for? How do secondary substances impact taste and smell? How have insects influenced plant evolution?", "com_reference": "The primary substances in plants, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are essential for growth and proper functioning. These substances are required by all plants for their basic metabolic processes and development.\n\nSecondary substances in plants are a diverse array of chemicals that contribute to the distinctive tastes and smells of plants. These secondary substances give plants their characteristic flavors and scents. They have no known role in the internal chemical processes of a plant's growth or metabolism.\n\nInsects have played a significant role in influencing plant evolution by driving the development of secondary substances. Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms, aiding in the plant's reproduction. Other secondary substances act as biochemical defenses against plant enemies, such as insects, deterring them from feeding or even causing harm. This evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to the development of various defense mechanisms in plants and adaptations in insects to circumvent these defenses, resulting in a complex co-evolutionary relationship between plants and insects over millions of years."}
{"ID": "agi_eval_848", "context": "At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, \"Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.\"40 He picked up a bird shape: \"Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought.\" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: \"Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind.\"As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. \"Look here,\" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. \"See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this.\" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. \"The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price.\"I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.", "com_question": "What was Father busy discussing with a customer?

{"ID": "agi_eval_853", "context": "During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted \"as it is\" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible \"reality\" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: \"The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.\" The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art \"a shameful destiny.\" A literary work must stand or fall on its \"artistic merit,\" he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is \"artistic\" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: \"To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.\" The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be \"useful\" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.", "com_question": "What position did Dostoyevsky take on reality? How did he define artistic merit?", "com_reference": "Dostoyevsky took a unique position on reality, viewing it as deeper and more complex than the prevailing perspectives of his time. He believed that reality was not limited to just the tangible and that there was no clear distinction between fantasy and reality. For Dostoyevsky, reality was shaped by the individual's experience, leading to a more nuanced understanding where different perceptions of reality could coexist.\n\nIn terms of artistic merit, Dostoyevsky defined it as the ability to express one's thoughts through characters and images in a way that ensures the reader fully understands the author's intentions. He emphasized the importance of writing well and creating fully realized artistic works that could fulfill their goals. Dostoyevsky rejected the notion that art must serve a particular political view or be deemed \"useful\" to society, believing that the true value and impact of a work of art may not always be immediately apparent."}

As the Kennedy Center’s artistic adviser for jazz, Moran hopes to widen the audience for jazz, make the music more accessible, and preserve its history and culture.“Jazz seems like it’s not really a part of the American appetite,” Moran tells National Public Radio’s reporter Neal Conan. “What I’m hoping to accomplish is that my generation and younger start to reconsider and understand that jazz is not black and write anymore. It’s actually color, and it’s actually digital.”Moran says one of the problems with jazz today is that the entertainment aspect of the music has been lost. “The music can’t be presented today the way it was in 1908 or 1958. It has to continue to move, because the way the world works is not the same,” says Moran.Last year, Moran worked on a project that arranged Fats Waller’s music for a dance party, “Just to kind of put it back in the mind that Waller is dance music as much as it is concert music,” says Moran. “For me, it’s the recontextualization. In music, where does the emotion(情感) lie? Are we, as humans, gaining any insight(感悟) on how to talk about ourselves and how something as abstract as a Charlie Parker record gets us into a dialogue about our emotions and our thoughts?

To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.", "com_question": "What type of evidence did Theis and Adler's research rely on? How many vines were planted in the Iowa field? Who were the main pollinators of the Texas gourd?", "com_reference": "The evidence presented in Theis and Adler's research relied on observational data collected by observing the behavior of bees and beetles on Texas gourd flowers.

{"ID": "agi_eval_898", "context": "I was in the middle of the Amazon (亚马逊) with my wife, who was there as a medical researcher. We flew on a small plane to a faraway village. We did not speak the local language, did not know the customs, and more often than not, did not entirely recognize the food. We could not have felt more foreign.We were raised on books and computers, highways and cell phones, but now we were living in a village without running water or electricity It was easy for us to go to sleep at the end of the day feeling a little misunderstood.Then one perfect Amazonian evening, with monkeys calling from beyond the village green, we played soccer. I am not good at soccer, but that evening it was wonderful. Everyone knew the rules. We all spoke the same language of passes and shots. We understood one another perfectly. As darkness came over the field and the match ended, the goal keeper, Juan, walked over to me and said in a matter-of-fact way, “In your home, do you have a moon too?” I was surprised.After I explained to Juan that yes, we did have a moon and yes, it was very similar to his, I felt a sort of awe (敬畏) at the possibilities that existed in his world. In Juan’s world, each village could have its own moon. In Juan’s world. the unknown and undiscovered was vast and marvelous. Anything was possible.In our society, we know that Earth has only one moon. We have looked at our planet from every angle and found all of the wildest things left to find. I can, from my computer at home, pull up satellite images of Juan’s village. There are no more continents and no more moons to search for, little left to discover. At least it seems that way.Yet, as I thought about Juan’s question, I was not sure how much more we could really rule out. I am, in part, an ant biologist, so my thoughts turned to what we know about insect life and I knew that much in the world of insects remains unknown. How much, though? How ignorant  (无知的) are we? The question of what we know and do not know constantly bothered me.I began collecting newspaper articles about new species, new monkey, new spider…, and on and on they appear. My drawer quickly filled. I began a second drawer for more general discoveries: new cave system discovered with dozens of nameless species, four hundred species of bacteria found in the human stomach. The second drawer began to fill and as it did I wondered whether there were bigger discoveries out there, not just species, but life that depends on things thought to be useless, life even without DNA. I started a third drawer for these big discoveries. It fills more slowly, but all the same, it fills.In looking into the stories of biological discovery, I also began to find something else, a collection of scientists, usually brilliant occasionally half-mad, who made the discoveries. Those scientists very often see the same things that other scientists see, but they pay more attention to them, and they focus on them to the point of exhaustion (穷尽), and at the risk of the ridicule of their peers. In looking for the stories of discovery, I found the stories of these people and how their lives changed our view of the world.We are repeatedly willing to imagine we have found most of what is left to discover. We used to think that insects were the smallest organisms (生物), and that nothing lived deeper than six hundred meters. Yet, when something new turns up, more often than not, we do not even know its name.", "com_question": "What was the author's initial feeling in the Amazon?

{"ID": "agi_eval_928", "context": "Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the \"best defense\" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered.

{"ID": "agi_eval_932", "context": "Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.", "com_question": "What types of literacy-related resources have become widely available due to technological developments? How has technology changed access to entertainment and distant communication?", "com_reference": "Several literacy-related resources that have become widely available due to technological developments include printed materials, books, periodicals, and public libraries. Technology, such as the printing press, has made literacy and the use of printed texts accessible to a larger number of people, regardless of their position or resources. This has led to essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that were once only available to a select few.\n\nRegarding entertainment, technology has significantly changed access to entertainment by making it more widely available. Broadcast technology, for example, has made entertainment options such as movies, TV shows, and music accessible to almost anyone. In previous centuries, only a few people with abundant resources could afford professional entertainment. Now, technology has enabled almost anyone to have an entertainment cornucopia that was unimaginable in earlier times.\n\nFor distant communication, technology has also played a crucial role in expanding access. In the past, communication with distant people was expensive and limited to only a few who could afford it. However, advancements such as inexpensive mail distribution, telephone connections, and electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication.

{"ID": "agi_eval_943", "context": "Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.", "com_question": "How do neurotransmitters influence electrical activity?

That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. \"In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?\" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. \"Gold is useless. Water will let you live.\"35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics.

No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's \"magnificent desolation\" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure.

They first found 10 overweight and inactive but otherwise healthy young men, whose lifestyles are, for better and worse, representative of those of most of us. They tested the men’s fitness and resting metabolic (新陈代谢的) rates and took samples (样品) of their blood and fat tissue.Then, on two separate morning visits to the scientists’ lab, each man walked for an hour at an average speed that, in theory should allow his body to rely mainly on fat for fuel. Before one of these workouts, the men skipped breakfast, meaning that they exercised on a completely empty stomach after a long overnight fast (禁食). On the other occasion, they ate a rich morning meal about two hours before they started walking.Just before and an hour after each workout, the scientists took additional samples of the men’s blood and fat tissue.Then they compared the samples. There were considerable differences. Most obviously, the men displayed lower blood sugar levels at the start of their workouts when they had skipped breakfast than when they had eaten. As a result, they burned more fat during walks on an empty stomach than when they had eaten first. On the other hand, they burned slightly more calories (卡路里), on average, during the workout after breakfast than after fasting.But it was the effects deep within the fat cells that may have been the most significant, the researchers found. Multiple genes behaved differently, depending on whether someone had eaten or not before walking. Many of these genes produce proteins (蛋白质) that can improve blood sugar regulation and insulin (胰岛素) levels throughout the body and so are associated with improved metabolic health. These genes were much more active when the men had fasted before exercise than when they had breakfasted.The implication of these results is that to gain the greatest health benefits from exercise, it may be wise to skip eating first.", "com_question": "What is the implication of skipping breakfast on exercise?

{"ID": "agi_eval_970", "context": "An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term \"prion\" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.", "com_question": "What is the main type of pathogen in CJD?

He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of \"points of identification\" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent \"points and characteristics\" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints \"match.\" There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a \"point-counting\" method that entails counting the number of similar \"ridge\" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.", "com_question": "How do fingerprint examiners determine if prints match?

{"ID": "agi_eval_988", "context": "Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.", "com_question": "What do proponents of multicultural education advocate?

The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent.

Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the \"physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature.\" To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.", "com_question": "What fundamental principle is uplifted in Passage 2? How are rights viewed in relation to moral beings? Do rights differ based on sex in the context of moral nature?", "com_reference": "In Passage 2, the fundamental principle that is uplifted is that human beings have rights because they are moral beings. Rights are viewed as inherent to all men and stemming from their moral nature. Since all men have the same moral nature, they essentially possess the same rights, which cannot be alienated. The passage argues that the circumstance of sex should not give man higher rights and responsibilities than woman, as rights are grounded in the nature of our moral being, not in physical differences. Therefore, in the context of moral nature, rights are seen as equal for both men and women, and sex does not determine the level of rights and responsibilities individuals have."}

{"ID": "agi_eval_999", "context": "Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.", "com_question": "What distance did the polar bear travel back home? Can polar bears navigate over long distances accurately?

{"ID": "agi_eval_1000", "context": "Doris: I've noticed that everyone involved in student government is outspoken. So if we want students to be more outspoken, we should encourage them to become involved in student government. Zack: Those who are in student government became involved precisely because they are outspoken in the first place. Encouraging others to become involved will do nothing to make them more outspoken.", "com_question": "What traits are common in student government members? How do Doris and Zack differ in their views?", "com_reference": "Common traits among student government members, as indicated by the passage, are being outspoken and actively engaged. Doris believes that encouraging students to join student government will lead to them becoming more outspoken. In contrast, Zack argues that those who are already in student government are outspoken individuals to begin with, implying that joining student government does not necessarily make someone more outspoken. Their differing views lie in whether one's involvement in student government is a cause or a result of being outspoken."}
