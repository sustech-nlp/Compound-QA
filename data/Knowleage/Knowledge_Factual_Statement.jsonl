The mean difference in spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68 ± 0.83 D, with significantly greater differences seen in hypermetropes compared to myopes (1.30 ± 0.90 D versus 0.46 ± 0.68 D, p < 0.001).\n\nRegarding the need for cycloplegic autorefraction in enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21, the study results suggest that there is indeed a significant difference in refractive error measurements between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic techniques. Therefore, to obtain accurate and reliable refractive measurements, especially for hypermetropes, performing cycloplegic autorefraction may be necessary in this age group.\n\nIn terms of the differences observed between hypermetropes and myopes, hypermetropes showed a significantly higher mean difference in refractive error between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements compared to myopes.\n\nFurthermore, when comparing moderate hypermetropes (2 to 5 D) to mild (0.5 to 2 D) and severe hypermetropes (>5 D) in terms of refractive error, moderate hypermetropes were found to have a significantly greater refractive error than both mild and severe hypermetropes. This suggests that the magnitude of refractive error may vary within different degrees of hypermetropia.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the study's findings, cycloplegic autorefraction may be necessary to accurately assess refractive error in enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21, particularly in hypermetropes. Additionally, significant differences were observed in refractive error between hypermetropes and myopes, with moderate hypermetropes showing the highest refractive error among the three groups compared."}

Each patient had between one and four conditions specified as having a highly developed evidence base (diabetes and hypertension) or a less developed evidence base (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a collection of acute conditions). Multilevel analysis that accounts for the nested and cross-classified structure of the data was used to estimate the signal and noise components of the measurement of quality and the reliability of implicit review. For COPD and a collection of acute conditions the reliability of a single physician review was quite low (intra-class correlation = 0.16-0.26) but comparable to most previously published estimates for the use of this method in inpatient settings. However, for diabetes and hypertension the reliability is significantly higher at 0.46. The higher reliability is a result of the reviewers collectively being able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients (p<0.007) and not due to less random noise or individual reviewer bias in the measurement. For these conditions the level of true quality (i.e. the rating of quality of care that would result from the full population of physician reviewers reviewing a record) varied from poor to good across patients.", "com_question": "In assessing care quality, what conditions were reviewed?

Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland. All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures.

During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses. Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]).

The Ki-67 antigen is a classic marker of cellular proliferation, but there is still controversy regarding the significance and importance of Ki-67 in tumor progression. In this study, we first detected Ki-67 expression in UTUC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, we quantitatively combined the results with those from the published literature in a meta-analysis after searching several databases. IHC results demonstrated that patients with muscle-invasive tumors (T2-T4) had higher Ki-67 expression than those with non-muscle-invasive tumors (Tis-T1), suggesting that high Ki-67 expression may be associated with the aggressive form of UTUC. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high Ki-67 expression had significantly poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggested that Ki-67 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio, HR=3.196) and DFS (HR=3.517) in UTUC patients. Then, a meta-analysis of the published literature investigating Ki-67 expression and its effects on UTUC prognosis was conducted. After searching the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases, 12 articles met the eligibility criteria for this analysis. The eligible studies included a total of 1740 patients with a mean number of 82 patients per study (range, 38-475). The combined results showed that increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease progression, with a pooled HR estimate of 2.081 and 2.791, respectively.

However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving. We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined. In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71).

{"ID": "pubmed_qa_387", "context": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "com_question": "Are mitochondria involved in lace plant leaf remodelling during programmed cell death?

A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM. We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes.

For patients with QRS voltage <30 mm, the IVSt/PWt ratio is further utilized, where a ratio >1.6 is consistent with HCM and a ratio <1.6 supports the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis. These variables are crucial for accurately differentiating between the two conditions, and the classification based on these features demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing hereditary transthyretin V30M amyloidosis from HCM."}

Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year. One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery.

Our neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night).

{"ID": "fiqa_518", "context": "\"The number one rule of thumb that will generally answer the \"\"is it taxable\"\" question for any money you may have or receive: \"\"Did you pay taxes on it already?\"\". Pretty much any money you actually get in your paycheck/DD has already been taxed (or at least the projected amount of tax has been withheld) is your money, to dispense with as you will (or according to your pre-arranged obligations, for most of it). Deposits paid are one such example; if you wrote a check or obtained a money order that they then cashed, that's still your money until it isn't; the contract states that it is being held effectively in escrow (though the landlord has free use of it so long as he can pony up according to the contract). Anything not used to pay for damages is yours, and you get it back. The ATM fee refund is trickier, but basically this is a benefit offered to you as a service by your bank. You front for the ATM fees incurred when withdrawing, and then those fees are refunded to you by your bank (effectively increasing the number of ATMs you can withdraw from \"\"for free\"\"). As long as there is no net income, it's treated like a mail-in rebate; you didn't gain any money, so there's nothing new to tax. There are a couple of specific exceptions to this otherwise overarching rule of thumb. One is Roth IRAs. Typically, on investments, you either pay income tax on the money going in and capital gains tax on the money coming out, or you pay nothing going in and income tax coming out. With a Roth, however, you pay income tax going in and nothing coming out, even though you're (eventually) getting back more than you put in.  Another is gifts. Whoever gave you the gift paid the taxes on it (or the money to buy it). However, if they give you a gift valued more than a certain limit (changes every year, and there's a lifetime limit), they have to pay an additional gift tax of 35% on any amount over the limit. That's taxing taxed income (usually).  There are other examples, but for the overwhelming majority of situations, if it's money you already had after any and all applicable taxes, it's not taxable even if you haven't seen that money for a while.\"", "com_question": "Is the money you receive in your paycheck already taxed?

As long as there is no net income from the refund, it is treated like a mail-in rebate and is not subject to taxation.\n\nExceptions to the general tax rule for income include Roth IRAs. With Roth IRAs, income tax is paid when the money is contributed into the account, but there is no tax on the withdrawals, even if the amount withdrawn exceeds the original contribution. This differs from the typical tax treatment of investments. \n\nIn summary, money received in a paycheck is typically already taxed, ATM fee refunds are not taxable if there is no net income, and Roth IRAs are an exception to the general tax rule as they are taxed differently."}

On the other hand, there is concern about the potential consequences of this increased productivity, such as stagnating wage growth and reduced economic mobility. As technology continues to advance, it may reach a point where individuals can meet their basic needs with minimal effort, potentially leading to questions about the purpose of work and how societies define success.\n\nA stress-free life can be interpreted in various ways depending on individual preferences and values. For some, it may involve having sufficient resources to meet their needs without the constant pressure of financial instability. Others may define it as having a healthy work-life balance, fulfilling relationships, or pursuing personal interests and passions without the burden of excessive stress or anxiety. Ultimately, a stress-free life is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person.\n\nEconomic mobility refers to the ability of individuals to move up or down the socioeconomic ladder over time. It is a crucial aspect of a healthy economy and society, as it reflects opportunities for individuals to improve their financial well-being and achieve their aspirations.

This relationship could have implications for the main character's predicament, as it may influence how he navigates legal or criminal repercussions related to his financial troubles.\n\nRisky Behavior: One risky behavior the main character could have attempted to address his financial woes is gambling. Gambling is often a high-risk way for individuals to try to quickly earn money to repay debts or cover expenses.

{"ID": "fiqa_535", "context": "\"Wow all the answers here are a joke. Retained earnings is a funding side (liabilities + equity) of the balance sheet accounting entry. It's a residual value, so if you end up funding your assets with more liabilities, for example, then retained earnings will be smaller.  When worrying about the funding side of the balance sheet, you should consider mainly (1) how much you want in the business of your own money (equity) and (2) how much debt your business can support, as well as how much debt you're comfortable with.  #2 is a function of looking at your income generating capacity. Once you've figured out how much you will fund with debt, you then need the remainder to be your money. Some of this is contributed capital, the rest is retained earnings. So to wonder about how much in retained earnings to have isn't really the way to think about it. You should have the \"\"debt vs. equity\"\" conversation with yourself and figure it out that way. Don't worry about the components of equity if you're a sole owner and it's all yours. (There are other ways to finance equity like preferred shares, but for all intents and purposes this is a small business).  From a risk perspective, retained earnings is largely irrelevant on a standalone basis. You should pay far more attention to your assets. For example, if you asked \"\"how much cash or working capital do I need?\"\", that's an operational question that's very important to know for running the business.

The remaining amount would then be considered as equity, with some being contributed capital and the rest as retained earnings. The passage recommends focusing on the overall \"debt vs. equity\" conversation rather than specifically trying to figure out the exact level of retained earnings to have.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, the passage suggests that it is more important to pay attention to the company's assets rather than solely focusing on retained earnings.

I'm not sure I could make as much with that degree while I attempt to transition careers.    As far as the emotionally taxing aspect, working with children who come from broken homes all day, every day is extremely exhausting mentally and for someone like me it is difficult to leave work at work in this line.  I become emotionally invested in the outcome of my work and have a hard time disconnecting and not caring when I am on my time.    The main reason I am looking at switching into this type of career isn't based around the earning potential.  Although this is an added benefit, the greatest reasoning is because a) this helping profession has left me burned out and I want to continue to help but in a less intimate way and b) my personality and strengths really fit with this type of career.

Ideal for careers that require critical evaluation, behind the scenes work, and a love for working with numbers and data.  I'll take a look at the WSO site and ask for some advice on there as well.

My student loan debt is unfortunately higher than I would like, but I come from a family of alcoholics, users, and I finished high school while living on friend's couches for the last two years - so it has been a necessary evil.  Having to pay on the loans if I were to stop the MS is also a factor but I know there are income-driven repayment plans available that I can take advantage of if my earnings aren't as high as I would like.

{"ID": "fiqa_560", "context": "\"Again, you're welcome.  It's also important to note (it really cannot be overemphasized) is that the taxes that were increased were/are virtually all the REGRESSIVE ones.  The rate of FICA taxation for example on rents, interest, and other \"\"capital gains\"\" (i.e. non-payroll income) -- were initially 0%, then later became 0%, and currently are 0%.  Meanwhile the FICA rate on average &amp; median payroll (wages/salaries of \"\"workers\"\" and \"\"mid-level managers\"\", etc) increased from 1% to 15% -- that's a 15x increase, or put another way, it is an increase of 1,500% during less than a single working career (the cost of absolutely NOTHING ELSE in the history of our society increased at anything like that rate; not even education and health care costs, nor even \"\"housing\"\" at the peak of the bubble -- and in actuality, just about everything else {including the notorious \"\"gasoline\"\" sold by those \"\"evil\"\" petroleum companies} actually DECREASED during the same time frame).  And then, during virtually the SAME time period, those other taxes increased in a similar (if less egregious) fashion. For example in my Midwestern state, there was no sales tax at all circa 1950.  A bit over a decade later, when it was first instituted it was initially set at 3%, but applied only to a select category of goods; subsequently the rate was increased (to 4%, then 5%, then with the addition of various county and municipal \"\"sales taxes\"\" to 6% and higher), and more critically, the goods and services that are subject to the tax has increased as well (many of them already with \"\"hidden/buried\"\" excise taxes -- so a large portion of the sales tax is actually a \"\"tax on a tax\"\").  When you realize that as wealth increases, the average expenditure on taxable goods tends does NOT tend increase in anything like a directly proportional manner (i.e. while a person making $50k a year, may pay more than 2x the total sales tax than someone making $25k a year {simply because a big part of the $25k a year goes to \"\"basic necessities\"\" of food, rent, etc}, and it is even possible that the person making $100k a year pays a simple 2x in sales tax of the $50k person... but the $1M a year is HIGHLY unlikely to be paying 10x the sales tax as the $100k a year person) then you begin to realize the way that the \"\"regressive\"\" form of those taxes work -- basically \"\"hobbling\"\" the middle class and preventing it from reaching \"\"upper\"\" middle class status.  Now to be ruthlessly blatantly forthright, it is NOT simply a matter of blaming the \"\"rich\"\" -- because the lion's share of those \"\"taxes\"\" were and are being used to \"\"redistribute\"\" money to an ever increasing number of non-working people (either retirees, or \"\"disabled\"\" former workers, etc) -- the vast majority of which were things \"\"demanded\"\" by the general population.  Hence the TANSTAAFL reality.  The means that the \"\"rich/elites\"\" have used to milk &amp; bilk the system may be *indirectly* linked to those taxes, but in general are actually much more likely to be based on other things (access to leverage/credit &amp; the socialization of bad bets/losses, avoidance of \"\"wages\"\" and emphasis on \"\"capital gains\"\", etc).  Doesn't mean the elites/wealthy AREN'T gaming/scamming the system (indeed, many of them are) -- but at least a significant part of the \"\"blame\"\" for the burdensome tax system lies with the people themselves.  As another example of the same thing, take \"\"healthcare insurance\"\" -- people want their \"\"insurance\"\" to not only cover the rare, large expenses (cancer treatment, major accident trauma, etc); but also to cover their \"\"annual checkups\"\", etc. -- and then are shocked (shocked I say) when their insurance premiums go UP.  Well, what do people expect? If virtually everyone goes for an annual checkup, and that checkup costs per policy are say $300 a year, then how can premiums NOT go up by approximately $300 (+ administration costs)?  Did they expect the money to pay those things to magically appear out of nowhere?  Seriously; you demand something and eventually (one way or another) you are going to pay for it.  ---  So in your father and grandfathers eras, they were able to support a larger family in no small part because they were NOT paying for all of those \"\"safety net\"\" things.  In addition, for what little \"\"safety net\"\" *did exist* at the time, the people collecting on it were [demographically tiny versus the larger working/paying class](http://www.ssa.gov/history/ratios.html) (i.e. in 1940 each retiree on social security was \"\"supported\"\" by nearly 160 workers; by 1950 the ratio was a tenth of that 1 retiree supported by 16 workers; by 1965 it was a quarter of that {1/40th of the 1940 ratio}, 1 retiree to 4 workers; and currently {2009} it is a 1 to 3 ratio {and set to get a LOT worse as the \"\"Baby Boomer Bulge\"\" retires en masse in the coming decade+}.)  So basically, your single income job still IS supporting a large \"\"family\"\" -- you just aren't supporting them *directly* any more {instead you pay the government, and they get checks \"\"from the government\"\"}; and the \"\"family\"\" you are supporting is probably NOT biologically related to you (i.e. they are someone *else's* kids, parents, etc).  And then, just as importantly, since you are no longer *directly* supporting a large family, YOU have essentially ZERO control over the hows/whens/whys of how the money gets spent (whereas your father and grandfather DID get to decide) -- instead the monies are being tossed as \"\"entitlements\"\" to the recipients, who, since they have been told (and certainly WANT to believe) that they are just getting \"\"what they are due\"\", don't feel that anyone has any RIGHT to tell them how to spend it.  (Sorta like as if when your father and grandfather were working, as if their wife, and each of their kids {as well as great grandpa Joe in the back bedroom, and maybe the \"\"disabled neighbor\"\" Dave} was LEGALLY GRANTED a government mandated \"\"allowance\"\" of 1/10th of your dad/grandad's paycheck -- and instead of your dad/grandad getting his full paycheck, the government required his employer to cut several paychecks paying those \"\"allowances\"\" directly to the wife, kids {whose checks would go directly to their schools}, grandpa joe, neighbor Dave, etc -- and they {other than the kids} were then able to spend it on whatever they wanted, and your dad/grandad wouldn't have been able to say \"\"boo\"\" about it.)

{"ID": "fiqa_561", "context": "\"(relix already hit on some of this)  It's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes...   All actual \"\"money\"\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)  Imagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...  - Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"\"hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\"\". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"\"prices\"\" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever.   - Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"\"Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\"\" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money.   - In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest.   Now, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The \"\"money\"\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere.   So far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:  - What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't \"\"go\"\" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting).   - The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been \"\"destroyed\"\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.  The above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests.   After the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold.   Now we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern \"\"bond\"\"...  (continued in a reply to this post...)\"", "com_question": "What is the concept of monetary debt? How are transferable notes created? What role does credibility play in issuing currency?", "com_reference": "The concept of monetary debt is explained in the passage through the example of issuing IOUs or promises in exchange for goods or services. In this scenario, actual money is viewed as debt, as it represents a promise to provide value in the future. Transferable notes are created when individuals exchange these promises with each other, leading to the emergence of a form of currency that can be used for transactions.\n\nCredibility plays a crucial role in issuing currency because it determines the trustworthiness of the issuer and the value of the notes being circulated. In the passage, it is highlighted that people will scrutinize the credibility of the issuer, and those who have a more credible system in place, like the example of the potato-farmer with a verifiable system of certification, are likely to earn more trust and credit in the community. As a result, the credibility of the issuer influences the exchange rate and acceptance of the currency in the community."}

If you are worried about taxes and your son's income being taxed at your rate, one way of deferring the issue is to buy US Savings Bonds. The interest can be deferred from taxation until the bonds are redeemed. Edit added in response to JoeTaxpayer's comments: But a better strategy is to declare the accrued interest each year as unearned income of the child on the kiddie tax form that is part of your tax return, and pay the tax, if any, that results To ease your mind or conscience, think of the tax that you pay on your child's behalf as a gift to your child! In any case, there will likely not be much tax due since the first $950 of unearned  income of a child is tax-free and the next $950 taxed at 10%. Then, when the bonds are cashed in, the interest that accrued (and was \"\"taxed\"\") in earlier years can be deducted  from the interest (cash in price minus purchase price) that you (or your son) will be told is the interest that the bonds earned. Of course, if kiddie tax is not a concern (and it shouldn't be, given the amount available for investment), an even better strategy is to set up the UTMA account(s) in long-term investments in low-cost index funds or ETFs (as JoeTaxpayer suggests) and pay the tax, if any, as it comes due.\"", "com_question": "How old is your son?

{"ID": "fiqa_591", "context": "\"Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) and Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) accounts in the United States are accounts that belong to your child, but you can deposit money into.  When the child attains his/her majority, the money becomes theirs to spend however they wish.  Prior to attaining their majority, a custodian must sign off on withdrawals.  Now, they are not foolproof; legally, you can withdraw money if it is spent on the child's behalf, so that can be gamed.  What you can do to protect against that is to make another person the custodian (or, perhaps make them joint custodians with yourself, requiring both signatures for withdrawals). UTMA/UGMA accounts do not have to be bank savings accounts; for example, both of my children have accounts at Vanguard which are effectively their college savings accounts.  They're invested in various ETFs and similar kinds of investments; you're welcome to choose from a wide variety of options depending on risk tolerance.  Typically these accounts have relatively small fees, particularly if you have a reasonable minimum balance (I think USD$10k is a common minimum for avoiding larger fees). If you are looking for something even more secure than a UGMA or UTMA account, you can set up a trust.  These have several major differences over the UGMA/UTMA accounts: Some of course consider the second point an advantage, some a disadvantage - we (and Grandma) prefer to let our children make their own choices re: college, while others may not prefer that. Also worth noting as a difference - and concern to think about - in these two.  A UGMA or UTMA account that generates income may have taxable events - interest or dividend income.  If that's over a relatively low threshhold, about $1050 this year, those earnings will be taxed (on the child's own tax return).  If it's over $2100 (this year), those earnings will be taxed at the parents' tax rate (\"\"kiddie tax\"\"). Trusts are slightly different; trusts themselves are taxed, and have their own tax returns.  If you do set one of those up, the lawyer who helps you do so should inform you of the tax implications and either hook you up with an accountant or point you to resources to handle the taxes yourself.\"", "com_question": "What types of accounts can you establish for children?

UTMA/UGMA accounts are accounts that belong to the child, but the parent or guardian can deposit money into them until the child reaches the age of majority. At that point, the child gains control over the funds. A custodian must sign off on withdrawals made before the child attains majority. On the other hand, trust accounts are separate legal entities that can be established to hold assets for the benefit of a child (or other beneficiaries).\n   \n2. With UTMA/UGMA accounts, the funds become the child's property once they reach the age of majority, and the child has full control over them. In contrast, trusts allow for more control over how and when the funds are distributed to the child, even after they reach adulthood.\n\n3. UTMA/UGMA accounts may have taxable events if the account generates income above certain thresholds. The earnings may be taxed on the child's tax return or at the parents' tax rate. Trusts themselves are taxed separately, and the trustee is responsible for handling tax matters. \n\n4. Additionally, UTMA/UGMA accounts allow for more direct control and beneficiary rights to the child once they reach majority, while trusts can offer more flexibility and customization in terms of how the assets are managed and distributed.\n\nUltimately, the choice between UTMA/UGMA accounts and trust accounts depends on factors such as tax implications, control over the assets, and the specific goals and preferences of the account holder and beneficiaries."}
{"ID": "fiqa_592", "context": "Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer.  The whole idea behind trading with Technical Analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time. For example, you might use a Moving Average (MA) as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days, hits the MA and then reverses and starts moving back up. If however, you also include a Stochastic Oscillator (SO) to indicate when the stock is oversold (under 20%), and if the price rebounds from the MA average at the same time as the Stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position, then this may be a higher probability trade. If you also only trade stocks that are Fundamentally healthy (as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks) then this might increase the probabilities again. Then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up, then this will increase your chances again. A few weeks ago at a seminar, the presenter totalled the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8. He then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room - a man or a woman? The statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next. This is what we try to do with Technical Analysis, increase our chances when we take a trade. Of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room, just like any trade can go against you, and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you. Lets look at an example where you could incorporate FA with TA to increase your chances of profits:  Above is a candlestick chart of Select Harvest (SHV), the green line above the price is the perceived value, the pink line is the 40 day MA, the blue line is the EPS, and the white lines is the Stochastic Oscillator (above 80% being overbought and below 20% is oversold). From Feb 2015 to start of Aug 2015 the stock was uptrending, since then the price reversed and started to downtrend. The stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price, and the EPS starting to increase regularly from mid April. Thus, as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the MA could be seen as a buy opportunity. In fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st March and 11th June where price had reversed and rebounded off the MA whist the SO crossed over in or near the oversold area. The price did reverse and then rebounded off the MA again on 9th July, however the SO was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion, so not as high in probability terms. The price still rebounded and went up again, however another momentum indicator (not shown here) shows some bearish divergence in this case - so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time. A good signal to get out of the trade, that is your stop loss has not already taken you out, is when the price breaks and closes below the MA line. This occurred on 7th August. So if we had bought on the first signal on 31st March for $7.41 and sold when the priced broke through the MA on 7th August for $11.76, we would have made a profit of approx. 59% in just over 4 months. If bought on the second signal on 11th June for $9.98 and again sold on 7th August for $11.76, we would have made about 18% in under 2 months. So the fundamentals, the Price (in relation to MA) and the SO where all lining up to provide two high probability trades. Of course you would need to incorporate you risk management (including stops) in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought. If the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances.  Unless you day trade, which I would avoid, a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day. That way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether. This can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules. After the price broke down through the MA we can see that a downtrend commenced which is still current today (in fact I just took a short trade on this stock yesterday). We can also see that the perceived value, whilst still above the price, has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the EPS after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months. So maybe the fundamentals are starting to waver a bit on this stock. It may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future. So basically you can continue using Fundamental Analysis to select which stocks to buy, place them in a watch-list, and then use Technical Analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades.", "com_question": "What is the purpose of using Technical Analysis? How does it increase trade probabilities?", "com_reference": "The purpose of using Technical Analysis is to analyze historical price movements and market activity to forecast future price movements. By using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time, Technical Analysis aims to increase the probabilities of a trade moving in the desired direction. For example, by combining indicators like Moving Averages and Stochastic Oscillator, traders can identify potential buying or selling opportunities when specific conditions are met, such as a price rebounding off a Moving Average while the Stochastic Oscillator indicates oversold conditions. This alignment of multiple indicators helps traders make more informed decisions and increase the likelihood of successful trades. Combining Technical Analysis with Fundamental Analysis, which evaluates a company's financial health and performance, can further enhance trade probabilities by selecting fundamentally strong stocks and timing entries based on technical signals."}

On the other hand, CDS buyers pay these premiums in exchange for protection against the credit risk of the underlying security. Unlike traditional methods of investing in corporate bonds, where there are limits based on the availability of bonds issued by the company, synthetics such as CDS allow investors to have more exposure to a company's credit risk as long as there is a counterparty willing to take the opposite position.

{"ID": "fiqa_598", "context": "\"Not to detract from the other answers at all (which are each excellent and useful in their own right), but here's my interpretation of the ideas: Equity is the answer to the question \"\"Where is the value of the company coming from?\"\"  This might include owner stakes, shareholder stock investments, or outside investments.  In the current moment, it can also be defined as \"\"Equity = X + Current Income - Current Expenses\"\" (I'll come back to X). This fits into the standard accounting model of \"\"Assets - Liabilities = Value (Equity)\"\", where Assets includes not only bank accounts, but also warehouse inventory, raw materials, etc.; Liabilities are debts, loans, shortfalls in inventory, etc.  Both are abstract categories, whereas Income and Expense are hard dollar amounts.  At the end of the year when the books balance, they should all equal out. Equity up until this point has been an abstract concept, and it's not an account in the traditional (gnucash) sense.  However, it's common practice for businesses to close the books once a year, and to consolidate outstanding balances.  When this happens, Equity ceases to be abstract and becomes a hard value: \"\"How much is the company worth at this moment?\"\", which has a definite, numeric value. When the books are opened fresh for a new business year, the Current Income and Current Expense amounts are zeroed out.  In this situation, in order for the big equation to equal out: Assets - Liabilities = X + Income - Expeneses the previous net value of the company must be accounted for.  This is where X comes in, the starting (previous year's) equity.  This allows the Assets and Liabilities to be non-zero, while the (current) Income and Expenses are both still zeroed out.  The account which represents X in gnucash is called \"\"Equity\"\", and encompasses not only initial investments, but also the net increase & decreases from previous years.  While the name would more accurately be called \"\"Starting Equity\"\", the only problem caused by the naming convention is the confusion of the concept Equity (X + Income - Expenses) with the account X, named \"\"Equity\"\".\"", "com_question": "What does equity represent in accounting?

{"ID": "fiqa_599", "context": "I can think of a few simple and quick techniques for timing the market over the long term, and they can be used individually or in combination with each other. There are also some additional techniques to give early warning of possible turns in the market. The first is using a Moving Average (MA) as an indication of when to sell. Simply if the price closes below the MA it is time to sell. Obviously if the period you are looking at is long term you would probably use a weekly or even monthly chart and use a relatively large period MA such as a 50 week or 100 week moving average. The longer the period the more the MA will lag behind the price but the less false signals and whipsawing there will be. As we are looking long term (5 years +) I would use a weekly chart with a 100 week Exponential MA. The second technique is using a Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator, which is a momentum indicator. The idea for timing the markets in the long term is to buy when the indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line. For long term investing I would use a 13 week EMA of the 52 week ROC (the EMA smooths out the ROC indicator to reduce the chance of false signals). The beauty of these two indicators is they can be used effectively together. Below are examples of using these two indicators in combination on the S&P500 and the Australian S&P ASX200 over the past 20 years.  S&P500 1995 to 2015  ASX200 1995 to 2015 If I was investing in an ETF tracking one of these indexes I would use these two indicators together by using the MA as an early warning system and maybe tighten any stop losses I have so that if the market takes a sudden turn downward the majority of my profits would be protected. I would then use the ROC Indicator to sell out completely out of the ETF when it crosses below zero or to buy back in when the ROC moves back above zero. As you can see in both charts the two indicators would have kept you out of the market during the worst of the downfalls in 2000 and 2008 for the S&P500 and 2008 for the ASX200. If there is a false signal that gets you out of the market you can quite easily get back in if the indicator goes back above zero. Using these indicators you would have gotten into the market 3 times and out of it twice for the S&P500 over a 20 year period. For the ASX200 you would have gone in 6 times and out 5 times, also over a 20 year period. For individual shares I would use the ROC indicator over the main index the shares belong to, to give an indication of when to be buying individual stocks and when to tighten stop losses and stay on the sidelines. My philosophy is to buy rising stocks in a rising market and sell falling stocks in a falling market. So if the ROC indicator is above zero I would be looking to buy fundamentally healthy stocks that are up-trending and place a 20% trailing stop loss on them. If I get stopped out of one stock then I would look to replace it with another as long as the ROC is still above zero. If the ROC indicator crosses below zero I would tighten my trailing stop losses to 5% and not buy any new stocks once I get stopped out. Some additional indicators I would use for individual stock would be trend lines and using the MACD as a momentum indicator. These two indicators can give you further early warning that the stock may be about to reverse from its current trend, so you can tighten your stop loss even if the ROC is still above zero. Here is an example chart to explain:  GEM.AX 3 Year Weekly Chart Basically if the price closes below the trend line it may be time to close out the position or at the very least tighten up your trailing stop loss to 5%. If the price breaks below an established uptrend line it may well be the end of the uptrend. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows. As GEM has broken below the uptrend line and has maid a lower low, all that is needed to confirm the uptrend is over is a lower high. But months before the price broke below the uptrend line, the MACD momentum indicator was showing bearish divergence between it and the price. In early September 2014 the price made a higher high but the MACD made a lower high. This is called a bearish divergence and is an early warning signal that the momentum in the uptrend is weakening and the trend could be reversing soon. Notice I said could and not would. In this situation I would reduce my trailing stop to 10% and keep a watchful eye on this stock over the coming months. There are many other indicators that could be used as signals or as early warnings, but I thought I would talk about some of my favourites and ones I use on a daily and weekly basis. If you were to employ any of these techniques into your investing or trading it may take a little while to learn about them properly and to implement them into your trading plan, but once you have done that you would only need to spend 1 to 2 hours per week managing your portfolio if trading long-term or about 1 hour per nigh (after market close) if trading more medium term.", "com_question": "What are the key indicators for long-term market timing?

Depending on what is being valued, that may or may not be an easy task. eg: to value your home, get a real estate appraiser, who will look at recent market sales in your area, and adjust for nuances of your property. To value your loan guarantee, you would need to figure out what it is actually worth to the business, which may be difficult. In a perfect world, you would be able to ask the bank to tell you the interest rate you would have to pay, if the loan was not guaranteed. This would show you the value you are providing to the business by guaranteeing it. ie: if the interest would be $100k a year unguaranteed, but is only $40k a year guaranteed, you are saving the business $60k a year. If the loan is to last 5 years, that's a total of $300k. Of course, it is likely the bank simply won't offer you an unguaranteed loan at all. This makes the value quite difficult to determine, and highlights the underlying transaction you are considering:  You are taking on personal risk of loan default, to profit the business. If you truly can't find an equitable way to value the guarantee, consider whether you understand the true risk of what you are doing. If you are able to determine an appropriate value for the loan, consider whether increasing your equity is fair compensation. There are other methods of compensation available, such as having the company pay you directly, or decrease the amount of capital you need to invest for this new set of equity.  In the end, what is fair is what the other shareholders agree to.

By calculating the difference in interest payments over the life of the loan, you can estimate the value that the guarantee provides to the business.\n\nWhen seeking equitable compensation, it is crucial to ensure that you thoroughly understand the true risk involved in providing the loan guarantee. Additionally, it is important to consider various forms of compensation that may be fair, such as having the company pay you directly or adjusting the amount of capital you need to invest in exchange for the equity.

{"ID": "fiqa_638", "context": "The situation you're proposing is an over-simplification that wouldn't occur in practice. Orders occur in a sequence over time. Time is an important part of the order matching process. Orders are not processed in parallel; otherwise, the problem of fairness, already heavily regulated, would become even more complex. First, crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators.  Crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another's ask, or a lower ask than another's bid.  A locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another.  HFTs would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees. Since these are forbidden, and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur, orders are serialized (queued up), processed in order of price-time priority. So, the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order. Regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair.  They would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid-ask cost to the holder.", "com_question": "What is the order processing sequence based on?

Orders are queued up and processed in the order in which they were received, with priority given to the order that was entered first at a specific price.\n\nCrossed and locked markets are forbidden because they can create unfair advantages for certain traders. A crossed market occurs when one exchange has a higher bid than another's ask or a lower ask than another's bid. A locked market occurs when a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another. These situations can lead to market manipulation and do not promote fair trading practices.\n\nTo avoid crossed or locked markets, orders are processed sequentially rather than in parallel.

{"ID": "fiqa_642", "context": "Since you seem determined to consider this, I'd like to break down for you why I believe it is an incredibly risky proposition: 1) In general, picking individual stocks is risky. Individual stocks are by their nature not diversified assets, and a single company-wide calamity (a la Volkswagen emissions, etc.) can create huge distress to your investments. The way to mitigate this risk is of course to diversify (invest in other types of assets, such as other stocks, index funds, bonds, etc.). However, you must accept that this first step does have risks.  2) Picking stocks on the basis of financial information (called 'fundamental analysis') requires a very large amount of research and time dedication. It is one of the two main schools of thought in equity investing (as opposed to 'technical analysis', which pulls information directly from stock markets, such as price volatility). This is something that professional investors do for a living - and that means that they have an edge you do not have, unless you dedicate similar resources to this task. That information imbalance between you and professional traders creates additional risk where you make determinations 'against the grain'.  3) Any specific piece of public information (and this is public information, regardless of how esoteric it is) may be considered to be already 'factored into' public stock prices. I am a believer in market efficiency first and foremost. That means I believe that anything publically known related to a corporation ['OPEC just lowered their oil production! Exxon will be able to increase their prices!'] has already been considered by the professional traders currently buying and selling in the market. For your 'new' information to be valuable, it would need to have the ability to forecast earnings in a way not already considered by others. 4) I doubt you will be able to find the true nature of the commercial impact of a particular event, simply by knowing ship locations. So what if you know Alcoa is shipping Aluminium to Cuba - is this one of 5 shipments already known to the public? Is this replacement supplies that are covering a loss due to damaged goods previously sent? Is the boat only 1/3 full? Where this information gets valuable, is when it gets to the level of corporate espionage. Yes, if you had ship manifests showing tons of aluminum being sold, and if this was a massive 'secret' shipment about to be announced at the next shareholders' meeting, you could (illegally) profit from that information. 5) The more massive the company, the less important any single transaction is. That means the super freighters you may see transporting raw commodities could have dozens of such ships out at any given time, not to mention news of new mine openings and closures, price changes, volume reports, etc. etc. So the most valuable information would be smaller companies, where a single shipment might cover a month of revenue - but such a small company is (a) less likely to be public [meaning you couldn't buy shares in the company and profit off of the information]; and (b) less likely to be found by you in the giant sea of ship information. In summary, while you may have found some information that provides insight into a company's operations, you have not shown that this information is significant and also unknown to the market. Not to mention the risks associated with picking individual stocks in the first place. In this case, it is my opinion that you are taking on additional risk not adequately compensated by additional reward.", "com_question": "What is your approach to stock picking? How do you manage research time? Have you considered market efficiency?", "com_reference": "The passage highlights the risks associated with picking individual stocks and emphasizes the importance of diversification, fundamental analysis, and market efficiency in equity investing. My approach to stock picking involves thorough research and analysis using both fundamental and technical methods.

I also consider market efficiency and acknowledge that publicly known information is likely already factored into stock prices by professional traders. Therefore, I strive to identify unique insights or information that could provide an edge in making investment decisions."}
{"ID": "fiqa_643", "context": "That makes no sense at all. They try to compare and that's exactly the same as comparing apples versus oranges. Mortgage is long-term loan, so for the first many years the huge part of the payment will go to repaying interest, so that ratio 1 will indeed be something like 20% or more despite the fact that the interest rate on the mortgage is much lower - something around 6%. HELOC will have the interest rate of 6%, but it will have the same structure so that you have equal payments, so if you compute that ratio 1 it will be very close to that of the mortgage. The bottom line is - if HELOCs were that great noone would apply for mortgages.

{"ID": "fiqa_644", "context": "\"You sound like you're well educated, well spoken, and resourceful, so I'm going to assume that you are somewhere in the neighborhood of top 5% material. That means you can pretty much do anything you want to if you put enough effort into it. There are two types of people in this world: those who run the world and those who live comfortably in it (and, of course, everyone else, but they are irrelevant to the discussion). Who do you want to be? I've been around a lot of wildly successful people, and they have two consistent traits:  connections and freedom. First, everyone always told me that \"\"it's not what you know, it's who you know\"\", but I never appreciated it until after college. The world runs on connections.  The more connections you have, and the more successful they are, the more successful you will be. Second, the more freedom you have, the more opportunity you will have to take chances, which is how you become wildly successful. Freedom comes from not being in debt (first) and having money (second). Why do you think Harvard grads are the guys that end up having so much money and power? It's probably because they grew up in a rich family which provided them money (freedom) and a wide social circle of rich people (connections). So you're not rich.  What to do? Well, the easiest way to get into that group is to go to college with them. And that means you need to get into Harvard or another Ivy League. Stanford if you want to be an engineer. College will be where you will make your most intense and long-lasting friendships.  That roommate at Harvard that you went on the crazy four-day road trip with may someday be CEO of a company... and when he needs a CIO, you can be damn sure you'll be at the top of the list if you're qualified. But Harvard costs a lot of money...which means you'll be in debt, a lot, when you get out of college. You'll have lots of rich, important friends(connections), but you'll be deeply in debt (no freedom). Most of these type of people end up becoming consultants at big firms because they pay well.   You'll live a comfortable life and pay off your student loans in five or 10 years.   Then you'll continue to live comfortably,  but at that point you'll be too old to take huge chances and too comfortable to change things (or perhaps you'll have a big mortgage =  no freedom). With a heavy debt load, it's almost impossible to, say, join an early stage startup and really be able to take huge chances.  You can do it, maybe.  Or, as an alternate option, you can do what I did. Go to a cheap state school and graduate with no debt. That puts you on the other side of the fence:  freedom, but no connections.  Then, in order to be successful, you have to figure out how to get connections. Goldman Sachs won't hire you, and everyone you meet is going to automatically assume you're mediocre because of where you went to college. At this point, your only option is to take big chances. Move to New York or San Francisco, offer to work for free as an intern somewhere or something.  It can be done, and it's really not too hard, you just have to have lots of spending restraint because the little money you have has to go a long way. So what are the other options? Well, some people are recommending that you think about not going to college at all. That will certainly save you money and give you a four year head start on whatever you decide to do (freedom), but you'll forever be branded as that guy without a college degree.  Think my second option above but just two or three times worse.   You won't even get that free internship, and you'll be that weird guy at dinner parties who can\"\"t answer the first question \"\"So, where did you go to college?\"\".  It doesn't matter if you're self-taught;  life isn't a meritocracy.  If you're very good, you'll end up getting a nice cushy job pushing ones and zeros. A nice cushy golden handcuff job. Well, you could go to community college. They're certainly cheap. You can spend very little money so you'll end up with fairly good freedom.   I might add, though, that community colleges teach trades, and not high-level things like management and complex architecture.   You'll be behind technically, but not as bad as if you didn't go at all. How about connections? Your fellow students will probably lack ambition, money, and connections. They'll be candidates for entry-level wage slave jobs at Fortune 500 companies after they graduate. If they get lucky, they'll work up to middle management. There's no alumni association, and there's certainly no \"\"DeVry Club\"\" in downtown Boston. At New York and Silicon Valley dinner parties, having a community college degree is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Indeed, the entire value of the community college degree will be what you learn, and you'll be learning at the speed and level of your classmates. My advice? If you get into an Ivy League school, go and hope you get some grants to help you out. The debt will suck, but you'll be well positioned for the future. Otherwise, go to a cheap second-tier school where you can get a large scholarship. There are also lots of third-party scholarships that are out there on the Internet you can get. I got a couple from local organizations. Don't work during college. Focus on expanding your network instead; the future value of a minimum wage job while you're trying to go through school is practically zero.\"", "com_question": "What type of connections are key for success? How does debt affect freedom? How can one balance connections and debt?", "com_reference": "In the passage, the key connections for success are highlighted as individuals with a wide social circle of rich and successful people. These connections provide opportunities, knowledge, and support that can lead to personal and professional growth.\n\nDebt can significantly impact freedom by limiting one's ability to take risks, make choices, and pursue opportunities. Being in debt can restrict financial independence and flexibility, making it harder to invest in new ventures or explore different paths without financial constraints.\n\nTo balance connections and debt, it is crucial to prioritize building meaningful relationships and expanding networks while also managing finances responsibly. One approach could be to seek out scholarships, grants, or other financial aid options to minimize debt while actively cultivating valuable connections through networking, mentorship, and professional relationships. Additionally, being strategic in pursuing educational opportunities that offer a good balance of both connections and financial stability can help in achieving long-term success."}

Higher wages, on the other hand, can reduce the reliance on social safety nets as employees are better able to cover their own expenses with their labor income. \n\nThe author of the passage seems to advocate for higher wages as a means to gradually decrease the need for taxpayer-funded social safety nets for working Americans. However, they emphasize the importance of not cutting social safety nets before advocating for higher wages, as individuals should not be left without needed assistance. \n\nIn general, it is essential to find a balance between ensuring fair compensation for employees through higher wages and supporting those in need through social safety nets. By addressing the issue of low wages first, the goal of reducing reliance on social safety nets for working Americans can be achieved in a more sustainable and equitable manner."}
{"ID": "fiqa_650", "context": "It depends a lot on your investment period and the quality of the bonds that you want to invest. For example, if you want to invest until the maturity of the bonds, and the bonds are very safe (i.e. they are not expected to default), it does not matter that the interest rate rise. That is because at the maturity of the bond it will converge to its maturity value which will be independent of the change of the interest rates (although on the middle of the life the price of the bond will go down, but the coupon should remain constant -unless is a floating coupon bond-). An option could be to invest in an ETF with short term bonds (e.g. 1 year) with AAA credit rating (high quality, so very low default rate).

{"ID": "fiqa_651", "context": "\"As Dilip said, if you want actual concrete, based in tax law, answers, please add the country (and if applicable, state) where you pay income tax. Also, knowing what tax bracket you're in would help as well, although I certainly understand if you're not comfortable sharing that. So, assuming the US... If you're in the 10% or 15% tax bracket, then you're already not paying any federal tax on the $3k long term gain, so purposely taking losses is pointless, and given that there's probably a cost to taking the loss (commission, SEC fee), you'd be losing money by doing so. Also, you won't be able to buy back the loser for 31 days without having the loss postponed due to the wash sale that would result. State tax is another matter, but (going by the table in this article), even using the highest low end tax rate (Tennessee at 6%), the $50 loss would only save you $3, which is probably less than the commission to sell the loser, so again you'd be losing money. And if you're in a state with no state income tax, then the loss wouldn't save you anything on taxes at the state level, but of course you'll still be paying to be able to take the loss. On the high end, you'd be saving 20% federal tax and 13.3% state tax (using the highest high end tax state, California, and ignoring (because I don't know :-) ) whether they tax long-term capital gains at the same rate as regular income or not), you'd be saving $50 * (20% + 13.3%) = $50 * 33.3% = $16.65. So for taxes, you're looking at saving between nothing and $16.65. And then you have to subtract from that the cost to achieve the loss, so even on the high end (which means (assuming a single filer)) you're making >$1 million), you're only saving about $10, and you're probably actually losing money. So I personally don't think taking a $50 loss to try to decrease taxes makes sense. However, if you really meant $500 or $5000, then it might (although if you're in the 10-15% brackets in a no income tax state, even then it wouldn't). So the answer to your final question is, \"\"It depends.\"\" The only way to say for sure is, based on the country and state you're in, calculate what it will save you (if anything). As a general rule, you want to avoid letting the tax tail wag the dog. That is, your financial goal should be to end up with the most money, not to pay the least taxes.

{"ID": "fiqa_661", "context": "\"For one thing fund managers, even fund management companies, own less money than their clients put together. On the whole they simply cannot underwrite 50% of the potential losses of the funds they manage, and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured. Warren Buffet owns about 1/3 of Berkshire Hathaway, so I suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to, and I won't guess why he prefers his own business model (investing in the fund he manages, or used to manage) over the one you propose for him (keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on B-H). Buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see B-H do well, and it's not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive. You say that the details are immaterial. Supposing instead of 50% it was 0.0001%, one part in a million. Then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this: \"\"invest 50 million, lose it all, and I'll buy dinner to apologise\"\". But would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50%? Then the details are material. Actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money, putting 50% into the fund and 50% into a cash account. If you make money on the fund, you only make half as much as if you'd been fully invested, so half your profit has been \"\"taken\"\" when you get back the fund value + cash. If you lose money on the fund, pay you back 50% of your losses using the cash. Worst case scenario[*], the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50% of your initial investment. The combined fund+cash investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit. The manager has offered the terms you asked for (-50% leverage) but still doesn't have skin the game. Your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect. Why don't fund managers offer this? Because with a few exceptions 50% is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash, and nobody would buy it. If you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank, open an account, and keep the interest for yourself. You don't expect your managed fund to do it. Furthermore, supposing the manager did invest 100% of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital, that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the fund's wins/losses. You've given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own: they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money. They're better off without you since there's less paperwork, and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them. If you think they can make better picks than you, and you want them to do so on your behalf, then you need to pay them for the privilege. Riding their coattails for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you. It turns out that you cannot force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio. Otherwise they can find ways to insure/hedge the risk they're required to take on. If it's on their books but cancelled by something else then they aren't really exposed. So to provide incentive what we normally want is what Buffett does, which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen, and to draw a salary in return for letting you in[**]. Their investment cannot precisely match yours because the fund manager's capital doesn't precisely match your capital. It doesn't cover your losses because it's in the same fund, so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with. But it does provide the incentive. [*] All right, I admit it, worst case scenario there's a total banking collapse, end of civilization as we know it, and the cash account defaults. But then even in your proposed scheme it's possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to materialise. [**] So why, you might ask, do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being part-paid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise? I honestly don't know, but I suspect \"\"lots of reasons\"\". Probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management. Probably the benefit to the fund itself, which wants to attract more clients, of beating certain benchmarks.

I shall try and answer the question through the above Indian example. India is running a budget deficit of 4 odd % for last 6-7 years, which means that gov.in is spending more than their revenue collection, this money is not in the system, so the govt. has to print the money, either the direct 4% or the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows to cover the 4% (don't confuse this with US printing post 2008). After printing, the supply of INR is more compared to USD in the market (INR is current A/C convertible), value of INR w.r.t. USD falls (in simplistic terms). There is another impact of this printing, it increases the money supply in domestic market leading to inflation and overall price rise. To contain this price rise, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increases the interest rates and increases Compulsory Reserve Ratio (CRR), thus trying to pull/lock-up money, so that overall money supply decreases, but there is a limit to which RBI can do this as overall growth rate keeps falling as money is more expensive to borrow to invest. The above (in simplistic term) how this is working.

This reduces the amount of money available for lending and spending, which in turn helps to reduce inflation as it restricts the money supply in the economy."}

Sending home a flier from school is a way for an insurance salesperson to get his/her message out to 800 families without any effort at all, and very little advertising cost (just a ream of paper and some toner). The biggest catchphrases used are the \"\"just pennies per day\"\" and \"\"in case they get (some devastating medical condition) and become uninsurable.\"\" Sure, both are technically true, but are definitely used to trigger the grown ups' insecurities. Having said that (and having been in the financial business for a time, which included selling insurance policies), there is a place for insurance of children. A small amount can be used to offset the loss of income for the parents who may have to take extended time away from work to deal with the event of the loss of their child, and to deal with the costs of funeral and burial. Let's face it, the percentage of families who have a sufficiently large emergency fund is extremely small compared to the overall population. Personally, I have added a child rider to my own (term) insurance policies that covers any/all of my children. It does add some cost to my premiums, but it's a small cost on top of something that is already justifiably in place for myself. One other thing to be aware of: if you're in a group policy (any life insurance where you're automatically accepted without any underwriting process, like through a benefit at work, or some other club or association), the healthy members are subsidizing the unhealthy ones. If you're on the healthy side, you might consider foregoing that policy in favor of getting your own policy through an insurance company of your choice. If you're healthy, it will always be cheaper than the group coverage.\"", "com_question": "What are some catchphrases used in insurance sales tactics? How can insurance for children be beneficial?

Additionally, having insurance for children can provide financial support in case of unexpected medical expenses. \n\nThe passage also highlights the insight that in group policies, healthy members may be subsidizing the unhealthy ones.

{"ID": "fiqa_718", "context": "A financial institution is not obligated to offer you a loan. They will only offer you a loan if they believe that they will make money off you. They use all the info available in order to determine if offering you a loan is profitable.  In short, whether they offer you a loan, and the interest rate they charge for that loan, is based on a few things: How much does it cost the bank to borrow money? [aka: how much does the bank need to pay people who have savings accounts with them?]; How much does the bank need to spend in order to administer the loan? [ie: the loan officer's time, a little time for the IT guy who helps around the office, office space they are renting in order to allow the transaction to take place]; and How many people will 'default' and never be able to repay their loan? [ex: if 1 out of 100 people default on their loans, then every one of those 100 loans needs to be charged an extra 1% in order to recover the money the bank will lose on the person who defaults]. What we are mostly interested in here is #3: how likely are you to default? The bank determines that by determining your income, your assets, your current debts outstanding, your past history with payments (also called a credit score), and specifically to mortgages, how much the house is worth.  If you don't have a long credit history, and because you don't have a long income history, and because you are putting <10% down on the condo [20% is often a good % to strive for, and paying less than that can often imply you will need mandatory mortgage insurance, depending on jurisdiction] the bank is a little more uncertain about your likelihood to pay.  Banks don't like uncertainty, and they can deal with that uncertainty in two ways: (1) They can charge you a higher interest rate; OR (2) They can refuse you the loan. Now just because one bank refuses you a loan, doesn't mean all will - but being refused by one bank is probably a good indication that many / most institutions would refuse you, because they all use very similar analytical tools to determine your 'risk level'. If you are refused a loan, you can try again at another institution, or you can wait, save a larger down payment, and build your credit history by faithfully paying your credit card every month, paying your utilities, and making your car and rent payments on time. This will give the banks more comfort that you will have the ability to pay your mortgage every month, and a larger down payment will give them comfort that if the housing market dips, you won't owe more than the house is worth. My parting shot is this: If you are new in your career with no income history, be very careful about buying a property immediately, even if you get approved. A good rule of thumb is to only buy a property when you plan on living there for at least 5 years, or else you are likely to lose money overall, after factoring closing costs and maintenance fees. If you are refused a loan, that's probably a good sign that you aren't financially ready yet, but even if a bank approves you for a loan, you might not be ready yet either.", "com_question": "What factors determine loan approval? How is loan interest rate calculated? What influences the likelihood of default?", "com_reference": "Factors that determine loan approval include the individual's income, assets, current debts outstanding, credit score, and the value of the property being mortgaged. Loan interest rates are calculated based on how much it costs the bank to borrow money, how much is spent on administering the loan, and the likelihood of default.

If the government actually pays people for the money they borrow, they don't have this problem - and as it turns out, the US government can get pretty good rates on borrowing in general, in part because they're extraordinarily good about paying them back. (Also, inflation expectations are low, so people will accept 1-2% interest rates. If you expected inflation of 10%, you'd see people demanding something more like 12% interest rates.) (The downside of too much of this sort of borrowing is that it \"\"crowds out\"\" other borrowing, which may harm the economy. Who would lend money to / invest in a small business, if the government is paying good money and there's almost no risk at all?) Now, inflation can come into play afterward, if the Fed decides it needs to maintain \"\"easy money\"\" policies to stimulate the economy (because taxes are too high because we're paying off the debt, or because we've crowded out smaller borrowers, or something). -- In general, you can count on the the principle that if you, as the government, try to play too many games with people's money... well, people aren't stupid; they will eventually catch on, and adjust their behavior to compensate, and then you're right back where you started, but with less trust.\"", "com_question": "What are typical interest rates in low inflation? How does excessive government borrowing impact small businesses?", "com_reference": "In low inflation environments, typical interest rates are usually around 1-2%. This is because inflation expectations are low, so people are willing to accept lower interest rates. However, if inflation were to rise significantly, say to 10%, then interest rates would likely increase to around 12% as people would demand higher returns to compensate for the eroding value of their money.\n\nExcessive government borrowing can impact small businesses in a number of ways. One major impact is that it can \"crowd out\" other borrowing, meaning that when the government is borrowing a lot of money, there is less available for small businesses to borrow. This can harm the economy by reducing investment in small businesses, which are often the engines of economic growth. If the government is offering attractive returns and there is almost no risk involved, lenders and investors may be more hesitant to lend money to or invest in small businesses, as the government borrowing may seem like a safer bet.\n\nOverall, too much government borrowing can lead to a situation where the government is distorting the market and potentially hindering the growth of small businesses, which are crucial for a thriving economy."}

In broad terms, the balances of your accounts and your future benefit won't change. It's only the source of these benefits that's changing. The Bloomberg article describes the changes this way: The state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of Sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state-run social security system... The state will assume control of 51.5 percent of pension-fund assets, including bonds guaranteed by the government and “other non-stock assets” After the change, Polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state-run pension system. The balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits shouldn't change, but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements. The effect this change will have on future benefits isn't clear, because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt, not solve it. The government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds, less money went into the government's fund, which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities.  The government's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt, but in exchange, the government is increasing its future pension liabilities. Years down the road, the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they're taking on today.

The state will take over 51.5 percent of pension-fund assets, including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non-stock assets. This means that the composition of retirement portfolios will change, with more reliance on the state-run pension system.\n\n2. **Future Benefits:** The balances of retirement portfolios and future benefits are not expected to change significantly. However, the impact on future benefits may depend on how well the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government makes.

Increasing future pension liabilities could potentially lead to the need for issuing more sovereign debt in the future.\n\n3. **State-Run Pension System:** The state-run pension system will be affected by the takeover of pension-fund assets and the increase in future pension liabilities. By assuming control of a significant portion of pension-fund assets, the state will have a greater obligation to provide pension payments in the future. The cancellation of government bonds held by private pensions will decrease the government's outstanding debt, but the trade-off is an increase in future pension liabilities that the government will need to manage.\n\nIn summary, the changes described in the passage indicate a shift in the source of retirement benefits towards the state-run pension system, potential implications for future benefits depending on government management, and an increase in future pension liabilities for the state.

Usually, debt holders (especially holders of senior debt) are paid first, and you're entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off. More often than not, equity holders probably won't get much. To give an example, corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options: liquidation or reorganization. In the US, these are called Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy, respectively. Canada and the United Kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations, although in the UK, reorganization is often referred to as administration. Many countries have similar procedures in place. I'll use the US as an example because it's what I'm most familiar with. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the company is liquidated to pay its debts. Investopedia's article about bankruptcy states: During Chapter 7 bankruptcy, investors are considered especially low on the ladder. Usually, the stock of a company undergoing Chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless, and investors lose the money they invested. If you hold a bond, you might receive a fraction of its face value. What you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page. In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization. The Investopedia article quotes the SEC to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens: \"\"During Chapter 11 bankruptcy, bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments, and stockholders stop receiving dividends. If you are a bondholder, you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds, new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds. If you are a stockholder, the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company. The new shares may be fewer in number and worth less. The reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive, if anything, from the company.\"\" The exact details will depend on the reorganization plan that's worked out, local laws, court agreements, etc.. For example, in the case of General Motor's bankruptcy, stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company.\"", "com_question": "What procedures are involved in US Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy?

Bondholders might receive only a fraction of the face value of their bonds, if anything.\n\nOn the other hand, in US Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company is handed over to a trustee for reorganization. During this process, bondholders may stop receiving interest and principal payments, and stockholders may no longer receive dividends. The outcome for equity holders in Chapter 11 bankruptcy can vary, as they might receive shares in the reorganized company in exchange for their existing stock. However, these new shares could be fewer in number and worth less than the original ones. Ultimately, the rights and potential benefits for equity holders are determined by the reorganization plan agreed upon, as well as other factors such as local laws and court decisions."}

{"ID": "fiqa_753", "context": "\"All else being equal, you should look for more volatile (riskier) stocks. Technically, it was all time value - the entire value of an \"\"out of the money\"\" option is time value.   What's confusing is that time value is affected by numerous variables, only one of which is time. The reason volatility is the one to look at is that all the rest are likely already intuitive to you, or are too minor an influence to worry about: Current risk-free interest rates and a stock's dividend payout during the life of the option affect the value of the call, but are usually minor infulences.   (Higher interest rates makes call values higher, and higher dividend yield makes call values lower.) Longer time to expiration will increase the value of the call, but you're pretty likely already focused on that. The strike price's proximity to the current price affects the call's value - agreeing to sell a stock 5% above current levels will pay more than agreeing to sell it 10% above current levels - but again, this is likely obvious to you. Volatility, or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day, is almost certainly the variable that's not already obvious. Stocks that jump all over the place have higher volatility than those that move more predictably.     The reason that options (calls and puts) cost more on higher volatility names is that options' payout is asymmetrical.  In the case of calls, the option holder gets all the upside, but none of the downside, other than what they paid for the opotion.     If one stock goes up or down $5 every day, and another goes up or down $20 every day and you could pay some fixed amount to get that stock's upside, but not have any exposure to its downside, other than that fixed amount, you'd pay more for the one that pays you $20 or $0 than you would for the one that pays you $5 or $0.    That's why higher volatility (meaning larger daily moves) makes optimum prices higher.\"", "com_question": "What factors affect the value of call options? How does volatility influence option prices?", "com_reference": "The factors that affect the value of call options include current risk-free interest rates, dividend payouts during the option's lifespan, time to expiration, and the strike price's proximity to the current stock price.

{"ID": "fiqa_762", "context": "\"These policies are usually called dread disease policies or critical illness insurance, and they normally aren't a good deal. Furthermore, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, such policies may become less common or disappear entirely. These policies aren't a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information, two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance. When you purchase an insurance policy, the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool, e.g. you and your fellow employees, if you get insurance through your employer. For health insurance, this average risk level is the average probability that you'll incur healthcare costs. The insurer's actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors, like your age, sex, current health, socioeconomic status, etc. Asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does. For example, you may look like a relatively low-risk individual on paper, but little does the insurance company know, BASE jumping is one of your hobbies. Because you know about your hobby and the insurance company doesn't, you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects. If the insurance company knew this, they would like to charge you a much higher premium, if they could. However, they can't, because a) they don't know about your hobby, and b) the premium may be decided for the entire group/risk pool, so they can't increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance. You may decide that because of your dangerous hobby, you do want to take advantage of your employer's healthcare plan. Unfortunately for the insurance company, they can't adjust their price accordingly. Adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets, so I didn't go into much detail here (too much detail is probably off-topic anyway). I can point you towards more resources on the topic if you're interested.  However, the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy.  By expressing interest in such a specific policy, e.g. a cancer insurance policy, you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease. In your case, you're signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it, and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk. Since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness, they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it. However, when you express interest in a disease-specific policy, this signals the existence of asymmetric information (your family history or other habits), and the insurer assumes you know something they don't that elevates your risk level of that specific disease. Since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies, the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them. They can charge you a higher premium because you've signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly above-average risk of contracting a specific disease*. Also, the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease. The policy will be priced accordingly, i.e. in such a way that isn't necessarily beneficial to you. Furthermore, most dread disease policies aren't guaranteed renewable, which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums, the insurance company doesn't have to keep insuring you. As your risk of developing the specific disease grows, e.g. with age, it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk. The company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles, so they decide not to renew your policy. The end result? The insurance company has the premiums you've paid previously, but you no longer have coverage for that illness, and ex post, you've suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future.  Dread disease policies are changing under the Affordable Care Act. According to healthcare.gov Starting in 2014, ... all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses, and plans purchased in the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges, must include a range of essential health benefits. The essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage; since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it, dread disease policies wouldn't seem to qualify. For more information, you can read the linked page on healthcare.gov or see Section 1302, subsection b), titled \"\"Essential Health Benefits Requirements\"\" in the law itself (p87). I imagine more details will be available on a state-by-state basis through 2014 and into 2015.  One legal source (see the discussion on p24) states that: whatever else the ACA does with excepted benefit policies, including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies, it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the ACA This seems pretty straightforward; a dread disease (or \"\"specific disease\"\" policy, as it's referred to in the article), won't count towards the minimum essential requirements. This may not be an issue for you, but for others, it's important to understand that you'll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies. The ACA spells this out in Section 5000(f) (see p316, which states that \"\"excepted benefit policies\"\" are excluded and defines them using the definition in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). **The PSHA specifically includes \"\"Coverage only for a specified disease or illness\"\" in their definition of \"\"excepted benefit policies\"\" (see section 2791(b), paragraph 3A on p82, so it's probably a safe bet that such policies won't count towards the minimum. Also, as Rick pointed out in the comments, the Affordable Care Act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans, so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease you're worried about, such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit. Deductibles, annual limits, and other factors may complicate this somewhat.  In the section about lifetime limits (Sec. 2711, p2), the Affordable Care Act states that: A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish ... lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary.  However, the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law The section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits, so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies. The law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the law's implementation is left up to individual states. Furthermore, certain parts of the law specify actions involving the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so these may require further codification in the future too. You should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract (see the next section).  Since a dread disease policy probably isn't a good idea, you'll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area (if your employer doesn't offer coverage). I've tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start. These points may change once the Affordable Care Act is implemented, so I'll try to keep them as general as possible.  Services - Above and beyond the minimum essential requirements, what services does the plan offer? Are these services a good match for you and/or your family, or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit? For example, my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small co-pay, so I don't need a separate dental plan, even though my employer offers one.  Choice - What doctors, clinics, hospitals, etc. are preferred providers under your plan? Do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist, or can you find one on your own? Are the preferred providers convenient for you? In my first year of college (about five years ago), my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach. This is something to keep in mind, depending on where you live.  Costs - This is a major one, obviously. Deductibles, copays, maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime, out-of-network costs, etc. are all variables to consider.  There are other factors, but since I don't have a family, other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies.  In place of a dread disease policy, you're likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy, perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once you've exhausted your standard insurance policy. However, this may be a moot point since the passage of the Affordable Care Act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway.\"", "com_question": "What factors influence insurance premiums? Can policies exclude specific diseases? How does ACA affect dread disease policies?", "com_reference": "The factors that influence insurance premiums include the individual's risk level, such as age, sex, current health status, and lifestyle habits. Adverse selection and asymmetric information, where individuals have more information about their own risk levels than the insurance company, play a role in premium calculations. These factors can lead to higher premiums for individuals with higher risk levels.\n\nInsurance policies can exclude specific diseases based on the type of policy. For example, dread disease policies typically focus on providing coverage for a specific illness, such as cancer. These policies are designed to address the risks associated with that specific disease and may include exclusions for other conditions.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) impacts dread disease policies by requiring all new health insurance plans to include essential health benefits, which may not include coverage for specific diseases like those covered by dread disease policies. The ACA also prohibits lifetime limits on most insurance plans, ensuring coverage for related expenses without a lifetime limit. Overall, the ACA may reduce the availability and relevance of dread disease policies due to the required inclusion of essential health benefits and limitations on coverage options."}

In   addition, the seller shall prepay the actual freight charges and bill   the buyer, through the Clearing House, the lowest published freight   rate for 73-foot railcars from Prince George, British Columbia to the   buyer's destination. If the lowest published freight rate from Prince   George, British Columbia to buyer's destination is a rate per one   hundred pounds, the seller shall bill the buyer on the weight basis of   1,650 pounds per thousand board feet. The term \"\"lowest published   freight rate\"\" refers only to the lowest published \"\"general through   rate\"\" and not to rates published in any other rate class.

To complete delivery, the seller   must deposit with the Clearing House a Delivery Notice, a uniform   straight bill of lading (or a copy thereof) and written information   specifying grade, a tally of pieces of each length, board feet by   sizes and total board feet.

{"ID": "fiqa_795", "context": "There are lots of sub-parts to your question. Let's takle them one at a time. Should I worry about an IRA at this age? Absolutely! Or at least some form of retirement account. When you are young is the BEST time to start putting money into a retirement account because you have so much time for it to grow. Compounding interest is a magical thing. Even if you can only afford to put a very small amount in the account, do it!  You will have to put a heck of a lot less money into the account over your working career if you start now. Is there a certain amount  you need for the IRA deduction? No. Essentially with a traditional IRA you can just subtract the amount you deposited (up to the contribution limit) from your income when calculating your taxes.  What kind of IRA should I get? I suggest a ROTH IRA, but be warned that with that kind you get the tax breaks when you retire, not now. If you think taxes will be higher in 40 years or so, then the Roth is a clear winner.  Traditional IRA: Tax deduction this year for contribution; investment   plus gains are taxed as income when   you take the money out at retirement. Roth IRA: Investment amount is taxed in the year you put it in; no   taxes on investment amount or gains   when you take it out at retirement. Given the long horizon that you will be investing, the money is likely going to at least double. So the total amount you are taxed on over your lifetime would probably be less with the ROTH even if tax rates remain the same. Is the 401K a better option? If they offer a match (most do) then it is a no-brainer, the employer 401K always comes out on top because they are basically paying you extra to put money into savings.  If there is no match, I suggest a Roth because company 401K plans usually have hidden fees that are much higher than you are going to pay for setting up your own IRA or Roth IRA with a broker.", "com_question": "What is the best time to start an IRA?

This is known as leveraging. Companies may choose to invest in opportunities that offer higher returns than the cost of borrowing.\n\nRegarding currency exchange risks, companies view them as potential challenges that can impact their profits. Fluctuations in exchange rates can affect the cost of imports, exports, and foreign investments, leading to financial uncertainties. To mitigate these risks, companies may use financial instruments like currency forwards or options to hedge against currency fluctuations.\n\nFor excess cash, companies may look for investment alternatives that offer a balance between risk and return. Some preferred alternatives may include short-term investments like money market funds, treasury securities, or corporate bonds. These options provide liquidity and potentially higher returns compared to traditional bank accounts. Companies may also choose to invest in equity markets, real estate, or other assets based on their financial objectives and risk tolerance."}

The annual savings from delaying a $2000 bill at a 1% interest rate amounts to $20, or about 40 cents per week.\n\nTimely payment of bills can impact your finances in several ways. If you pay your bills on time, you avoid incurring late fees and interest charges, which can help you save money in the long run. However, if you delay payments and risk them being late, the late fees and interest charges that you may incur could negate any potential savings from delaying the payments.\n\nIn summary, factors such as bill amount, timing of payment, and potential interest earnings can all impact the savings from delaying bill payments.

In order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments. The best advice would be to take a list of all options that your employer allows and talk with a financial advisor. Here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer: Definitions from wikipedia: A target-date fund – also known as a lifecycle, dynamic-risk or age-based fund – is a collective investment scheme, usually a mutual fund, designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. An index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme (usually a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market... An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.[1] An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features. The capital stock (or stock) of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of its owners. Which one can you lose everything in? You can lose everything in stocks by the company going under. In Index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse. The chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies. The S&P 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the U.S.  A Pacific-Europe index such as MSCI EAFE Index is made up of 907 companies. The chances of losing everything in an ETF are also slim. The ETF that follows the S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies. An Pacific-Europe ETF such as MSCI EAFE ETF is made up of 871 companies. Target date funds are also slim to lose everything. Target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age. What would I recommend? I would recommend the Index funds and/or ETFs that have the lowest fee that make up the following strategy for your age: Why Not Target Date Funds or Stocks? Target date funds have high fees. Later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio. At that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections. Stocks are too risky for you with your current knowledge. If your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your Index funds or ETFs.", "com_question": "What are the main investment options for a 401k? How do target-date funds differ from index funds and ETFs?", "com_reference": "The main investment options for a 401k typically include target-date funds, index funds, ETFs, and sometimes company stock.\n\nTarget-date funds differ from index funds and ETFs in their approach to asset allocation over time. A target-date fund is designed to become more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. They typically include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments, and are automatically rebalanced to align with the investor's timeline.\n\nOn the other hand, index funds and ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500 or MSCI EAFE Index. They offer diversified exposure to a broad market, typically with lower fees compared to actively managed funds. Index funds are mutual funds that track an index, while ETFs are traded on stock exchanges and have intraday pricing.\n\nIn summary, target-date funds are a hands-off approach that adjusts the investment mix over time, while index funds and ETFs provide broad market exposure with lower fees and can be actively managed by the investor. It is important to consider your risk tolerance, investment goals, and fees when selecting the best option for your 401k."}

You can probably read the whole article then research some of the other ones listed there to come up with a conclusion.  Below are some excerpts:  Abstract: This article introduces the subject of technical analysis in the foreign exchange market, with emphasis on its importance for questions of market efficiency.  “Technicians” view their craft, the study of price patterns, as exploiting traders’ psychological regularities.  The literature on technical analysis has established that simple technical trading rules on dollar exchange rates provided 15 years of positive, risk-adjusted returns during the 1970s and 80s before those returns were extinguished.  More recently, more complex and less studied rules have produced    more modest returns for a similar length of time.  Conventional explanations that rely on risk adjustment and/or central bank intervention do not plausibly justify the observed excess returns from following simple technical trading rules.  Psychological biases, however, could contribute to the profitability of these rules. We view the observed pattern of excess returns to technical trading rules as being consistent with an adaptive markets view of the world.    and  The widespread use of technical analysis in foreign exchange (and   other) markets is puzzling because it implies  that either traders are   irrationally making decisions on useless information or that past   prices contain useful  information for trading.  The latter   possibility would contradict the “efficient markets hypothesis,”   which holds that  no trading strategy should be able to generate   unusual profits on publicly available information—such as past    prices—except by bearing unusual risk. And the observed  level of   risk-adjusted profitability measures market  (in)efficiency. Therefore   much research effort has been directed toward determining whether   technical analysis is  indeed profitable or not. One of the earliest   studies, by Fama and Blume (1966), found no evidence that a particular   class of TTRs could earn abnormal profits in the stock market.   However, more recent research by Brock,  Lakonishok and LeBaron (1992)   and Sullivan, Timmermann an d White (1999) has provided contrary   evidence. And  many studies of the foreign exchange market have found   evidence that TTRs can generate persistent profits (Poole  6  (1967),   Dooley and Shafer (1984), Sweeney (1986), Levich and Thomas (1993),   Neely, Weller and Dittmar (1997),  Gençay (1999), Lee, Gleason and   Mathur (2001) and Martin (2001)).", "com_question": "What is the subject of the article?

The article also explores the debate over whether technical trading rules can generate abnormal profits, with some studies providing evidence in support of it, contrary to the efficient markets hypothesis."}

SO is not very financially savvy and has very little idea about how much we earn  ...and ignorance.   You are entirely correct to worry about the conversation. Fear plus ignorance equals disastrous conversations. I manage our finances. Apparently your SO wishes to have input on the management of your finances without understanding them. It strikes me that this serves neither of you well. I would note that it is exceedingly difficult to rationally argue someone out of a position that they arrived at through irrational fear and ignorance. So I wouldn't start by having a conversation about charitable giving at all. Rather, I would start by addressing the ignorance, because that's the easy one.  how high up we are in terms of being in the top y% of households by income Income is irrelevant to the fearful; income can vanish with debts remaining. If your SO is not earning much of that income then SO's future financial security is dependent on the whims of another, which has already turned out badly once for SO.  Focusing on raw income is the wrong way to go; focusing on an abstraction like percentile is even more irrelevant. The figures to focus on are not income and percentile, but rather net worth and change in net worth over time.  Income $300K, expenses $350K eventually leads to poverty if you lack net worth, even if you are in the 1% of income earners. Open up with \"\"how much do you think we earn?\"\" Playing rhetorical games with ignorant people seems both risky and perhaps unethical to me, and it seems unlikely to engender trust. I would approach this situation by first removing the ignorance, rather than attempting to take advantage of it for rhetorical purposes.  I would also institute a policy that ignorant people don't get a say. If SO wants to abrogate financial responsibility to you, then SO should accept your decisions without question. If SO wants to have a say in your joint financial life then SO has a responsibility to make recommendations based on both facts and feelings, not just feelings. So, how to remove this ignorance? This will take some doing, but not much. Go through your records and account for: From that you can compute your net worth. Then go back a few years and account for: From this you can show the effect of your past prudent decisions on your net worth. There should be no percentages. There should be no math more complicated than adding and subtracting, and it should be very clear what adds and substracts to what.  People who are financially savvy are extremely intimidated by jargon. If some of your increase in net worth came from a realized capital gain less taxes do not say \"\"realized capital gain less taxes\"\" on your summary document. There should be no \"\"depreciation\"\" or \"\"cost basis\"\" or anything even vaguely like that. Even \"\"assets\"\" and \"\"liabilities\"\" are too jargonish. \"\"Possessions\"\" and \"\"debts\"\" are more easily understood. I'm thinking something like: My SO is financially savvy and still I do this about twice a year; it's helpful for both of us to have a quick summary of what's coming in, what's going out, and what we've got. Once the ignorance is gone, then start working on the fear. It sounds like the fear comes from a betrayal of trust, so it's not just enough to be trustworthy, you've got to consistently appear trustworthy. A great way to do that is to keep doing what I already suggested: on a regular, ongoing basis inform SO of how you are doing financially. When SO sees that net worth is consistently improving over time, that you are not one bad decision away from poverty, the fear should diminish.

{"ID": "fiqa_888", "context": "\"The tax system in general, and income tax in particular, is used for several purposes at once. One of those purposes is to raise money to run the government. It isn't the only purpose of income tax, and income tax isn't the only source of money to run the government. Try a thought experiment: let's say it costs $10,000 per person per year to run the government. (It might actually cost far more or far less, that's not the point.) A super simple tax system would just ask each person for $10,000. But such a system isn't fair. Some people don't even earn $10,000 so they are literally not able to pay that. Some people, who earn a lot, can easily afford to pay more. So a still-pretty simple approach asks each person to pay a particular percentage of their income, and the hope is that this will add up to enough to run the government. This still doesn't feel fair to everyone - 10% of your income is hard to find when you're spending it all on rent and food, and easy to find when you have way more than you \"\"need\"\". So many countries have what's called a \"\"progressive\"\" system of income tax where you pay no tax on the first X of your income, then a small percentage on the next Y, a larger percentage on the next Z and so on.  But you asked about business profit. Some places don't tax business profits at all - they just collect income taxes on people once the money reaches them as salary or dividends. Other places do. Just as a person who doesn't earn any income can't send the government money, a business that spent more on expenses than it brought in as revenue can't send the government money either. So the tax is on profit. That seems fairer to most people anyway. Things then get even more complicated for both business and personal income taxes because the government uses the system to encourage certain behaviours and to help people facing hard times. If you want to encourage people to get training and move into higher paying jobs, you might make tuition tax deductible. Most countries give a tax deduction for each small child you have. This isn't because people with children use less of the services government provides, is it? Instead it's an acknowledgement that people with children generally have less money to spend. Or an encouragement to have children, or something. Tax motivations are complicated.  If you charged all businesses a flat tax regardless of whether they were making or losing money, people might be hesitant to start companies that lose money at first. There might be less entrepreneurship in that country. If instead you only tax profits, it feels fairer and more people are likely to join in. So that's what most governments do. Is the imaginary business owner who is not turning a profit somehow getting a free ride? They are still paying tax. If they took any salary for themselves, there was personal income tax on that. Everything the company bought, it paid sales tax on. There may have been excise taxes and such in other things they bought. The economic activity of the business has been driving the wheel of the local economy and spinning off some taxes at various levels that whole time. Whether the business itself is chipping in some corporate income tax too may not end up being particularly relevant. Example: a sole proprietor has revenue of $100,000 and spends $10,000 on supplies and such. If the salary to the owner is $89,000 the company has a $1000 profit which it pays tax on. If the salary to the owner is $91,000 the company has a $1000 loss and doesn't pay tax (and may be able to use the loss to reduce taxes in a future year.) So what? The owner is paying personal income tax on roughly $90,000. The government is getting the support it needs. Yes, some owners do all the \"\"encouraged\"\" things so that some income is not taxed either in the business or the personal sphere. That is presumably what the government wanted when it set those things up as deductions. Making charitable contributions, hiring new employees, building new facilities ... essentially the government is paying the business to do those things because they're good for the country. The overall government budget (funded by personal and corporate income tax along with sales tax, excises taxes etc) is supposed to achieve certain goals which include roads and schools but also job creation and the like. This is one of the ways they do that.\"", "com_question": "What motivates governments to use income tax? How does the taxation differ for businesses?", "com_reference": "Governments use income tax for several purposes, one of which is to raise money to run the government. Income tax is not the only source of revenue, as governments also collect taxes from other sources. Income tax aims to be fair by asking individuals to pay a percentage of their income, with progressive tax systems in place in many countries to ensure those who can afford to pay more contribute proportionally. Business profits are generally taxed, with taxes collected once the money reaches individuals as salary or dividends. The taxation for businesses is based on their profit rather than just their revenue, as taxing profit is often seen as fairer. Additionally, governments use the tax system to encourage certain behaviors, such as offering tax deductions for training or for having children. Taxes on businesses and individuals are meant to support government goals, including funding public services, job creation, and economic development."}

{"ID": "fiqa_897", "context": "All forms of liquid investing necessarily have the same expected value. If any one form were more profitable, money would flood in, equalizing it. Day trading is unusual in two key ways. First, although the expected value is the same, the risk profile is very different. For example, would you wager a dollar on the flip of a coin?  You might.  Why not, after all? Would you wager a million dollars?  Probably not. The risk is too great. Similarly, day trading can easily lose you all of your investment, which is why you should be careful doing it. (In his memoirs Liar's Poker, Michael Lewis tells an anecdote about a rich bond trader who proposes a million-dollar, even-money bet with his rival, an amount both could just barely afford to lose.  The rival, not wanting to play but not wanting to lose face by declining, accepted.. with the proviso that the stakes be raised to 10 million dollars! The trader backed down.) Also, the efficient market only guarantees the price will be efficient.  It says nothing about transaction costs.  A busy day-trader can easily incur thousands in commission and other fees.", "com_question": "What is the risk profile of day trading? Why should one be careful? How can transaction costs impact day traders?", "com_reference": "The risk profile of day trading is very different compared to other forms of liquid investing. While the expected value may be the same, the risk is substantially higher in day trading. Day trading can easily result in a complete loss of investment due to the volatile nature of the market and the rapid fluctuations in stock prices. One should be careful when engaging in day trading because of the high level of risk involved. Just like one may hesitate to wager a large sum of money on the flip of a coin due to the potential loss, engaging in day trading carries a similar level of risk where significant financial loss is possible.\n\nTransaction costs can also impact day traders significantly. A day trader who is actively buying and selling stocks throughout the day can incur substantial transaction costs in the form of commissions, fees, and other charges. These transaction costs can eat into the trader's profits and potentially turn a winning trade into a losing one. It is important for day traders to carefully consider the impact of transaction costs on their overall profits and to factor these costs into their trading strategies."}

When (the manager of) a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit, or receives dividends (stock dividends, bond interest, etc.), the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money (at corporate rates) and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund, or passing on the entire amount (categorized as dividends, qualified dividends, net short-term capital gains, and net long-term capital gains) to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates. (If the net gains are negative, i.e. losses, they are not passed on to the shareholders. See the last paragraph below).  A shareholder doesn't have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund: the option of receiving the money as cash always exists, as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family, e.g. invest the distributions from Vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund into Vanguard's Total Bond Index Fund (and/or vice versa). This last can be done without needing a brokerage account, but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account. Such cross-transfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in re-balancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year. Those investing in load funds instead of no-load funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for re-investment of distributions but some funds don't: the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account. As Ben points out, a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes (in the appropriate categories) on the distributions  from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested. It is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution (say $1.22 a share), the Net Asset Value per share drops by the same amount (assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds) and the new shares issued are at this lower price. That is, there is no change in the value of the investment: if you had $10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared, you still have $10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously. (In actuality, the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later, not immediately when the distribution is declared).  In short, a distribution  from a mutual fund that is re-invested leads to no change in your net assets, but does increase your tax liability. Ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or re-invested elsewhere. As a final remark, net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains. See also this previous answer  or this one.", "com_question": "What tax options do shareholders have? Can they reinvest in a different fund or only the same family? What happens to net capital losses within the fund?", "com_reference": "In the passage you provided, shareholders of a mutual fund have the option to either receive distributions from the fund as cash or reinvest them back into the same fund or a different fund within the same family. If they choose to reinvest in a different mutual fund within the same family, they can do so without needing a brokerage account. However, if they want to invest in a fund outside the current family, the money would need to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account.\n\nNet capital losses within the mutual fund are not passed on to shareholders but are retained within the fund. These losses can be utilized to offset future capital gains within the fund, potentially reducing the tax burden for shareholders in the future."}

If it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it.   Point being is that you need to go after the asset.   If there is no asset you need to go after you \"\"friend\"\".  Again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and garnishing wages from your friend to going to small claims court.  Part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution.  By letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you - they are good at tracking people down for free. Also the lender may be able to give you options.  For example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty.  If a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default.  If they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you.  I worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping.  It went down like this... Co-signer gets pissed like you and calls bank, bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default, cosigner defaults, banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle, cosigner helps or actually repos vehicle, bank gets car back, bank inspects car, bank asks cosigner for X amount (sometimes nothing but not usually), cosigner pays X, bank does not hit cosigners credit, bank releases loan and sells car.  I am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition, that cosigner can get to the asset, and that the \"\"friend\"\" still is around and trusts cosigner.  I have seen more than a few cosigners promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the \"\"friend\"\".   I basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you haven't provided enough info to give perfect advice.  Seeking a lawyer is a joke.  Going after a fleeing party could eat up 40-50 billable hours.  It isn't like you are suing a business or something.  The lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan - and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have bled you dry - just really unsound advice.

What I can tell you is that when most investors talk about the \"\"power of compound interest,\"\" they are not actually necessarily talking about interest!

Your investment grows exponentially. This doesn't just apply to interest payments, however, but can apply to any type of investment where the profits of the investment cause the investment to get larger.  For example, if you invest in a company's stock, and the value of the stock goes up 10% in a year, after that year your investment is worth more than it was at the beginning. If it goes up another 10% the following year, you have gained more money in the second year than you did in the first. Your gains are compounding, even though interest payments are not involved at all. The same is true if you reinvest dividends or if you use business profit to expand your business, for example.

{"ID": "fiqa_990", "context": "As others have stated, the current price is simply the last price at which the security traded. For any given tick, however, there are many bid-ask prices because securities can trade on multiple exchanges and between many agents on a single exchange. This is true for both types of exchanges that Chris mentioned in his answer. Chris' answer is pretty thorough in explaining how the two types of exchanges work, so I'll just add some minor details. In exchanges like NASDAQ, there are multiple market makers for most relatively liquid securities, which theoretically introduces competition between them and therefore lowers the bid-ask spreads that traders face. Although this results in the market makers earning less compensation for their risk, they hope to make up the difference by making the market for highly liquid securities. This could also result in your order filling, in pieces, at several different prices if your brokerage firm fills it through multiple market makers. Of course, if you place your order on an exchange where an electronic system fills it (the other type of exchange that Chris mentioned), this could happen anyway.  In short, if you place a market order for 1000 shares, it could be filled at several different prices, depending on volume, multiple bid-ask prices, etc. If you place a sizable order, your broker may fill it in pieces regardless to prevent you from moving the market. This is rarely a problem for small-time investors trading securities with high volumes, but for investors with higher capital like institutional investors, mutual funds, etc. who place large orders relative to the average volume, this could conceivably be a burden, both in the price difference across time as the order is placed and the increased bookkeeping it demands.  This is tangentially related, so I'll add it anyway. In cases like the one described above, all-or-none (AON) orders are one solution; these are orders that instruct the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction. Most brokers offer these, but there are some caveats that apply to them specifically. (I haven't been able to find some of this information, so some of this is from memory).  All-or-none orders are only an option if the order is for more than a certain numbers of shares. I think the minimum size is 300 or 400 shares.  Your order won't be placed until your broker places all other orders ahead of it that don't have special conditions attached to them.  I believe all-or-none orders are day orders, which means that if there wasn't enough supply to fill the order during the day, the order is cancelled at market close.  AON orders only apply to limit orders. If you want to replicate the behavior of a market order with AON characteristics, you can try setting a limit buy/sell order a few cents above/below the current market price.", "com_question": "What types of exchanges did Chris mention? Do market makers compete on NASDAQ? How do AON orders work?", "com_reference": "Chris mentioned two types of exchanges in the passage: one where multiple market makers trade relatively liquid securities (like NASDAQ) and the other type where an electronic system fills orders.\n\nMarket makers do compete on exchanges like NASDAQ. The presence of multiple market makers for most relatively liquid securities on NASDAQ introduces competition between them, theoretically leading to lower bid-ask spreads that traders face. This competition can benefit traders by potentially providing better prices due to the market makers vying for trades.\n\nAll-or-none (AON) orders work by instructing the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction. These orders are typically available for orders of more than a minimum number of shares (e.g., 300 or 400 shares). AON orders are typically day orders and only apply to limit orders. If the order cannot be filled during the day, it is usually cancelled at market close.

{"ID": "fiqa_998", "context": "I wrote this in another thread but is also applicable here. In general people make some key mistakes with property: Not factoring in depreciation properly. Houses are perpetually falling down, and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well - particularly in bad areas. Accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 5-20% range per year depending on the property/area. Add insurance to this as well or be prepared to lose the whole thing in a disaster. Related to 1), they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve, when in reality a lot of the house price 'rise' is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up. No investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1) so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth (in your example, they could well be lagging inflation/barely growing if you are not pricing in upkeep and depreciation properly). Failure to price in the huge transaction costs (often 5%+ per sale) and capital gains/other taxes (depends on the exact tax structure where you are). These add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently. Costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents. Having to fill, check, evict, fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise, and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone else’s. Again, has to be factored in. Liquidity issues. Selling houses in down markets is very, very hard. They are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly. Houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices. As the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage (rents collapse, loss of job etc) they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system (negative equity etc). These factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses. Finally, if you’re young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited. Renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise. Locking yourself into 20 yr+ contracts/landlord activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential. Without more details on the exact legal framework, area, house type etc it’s hard to give more specific advise, but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above, so if the numbers you’re running are coming out close (and they are here), it’s probably not worth it, and you’re better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds.", "com_question": "What are the main mistakes people make with property investments? How do factors like depreciation and transaction costs impact property investment decisions? What risks are associated with property investments, particularly related to liquidity and earnings potential?", "com_reference": "The main mistakes people make with property investments, as highlighted in the passage, include not factoring in depreciation properly, failing to consider transaction costs and taxes, underestimating the time and effort required for rental property management, overlooking liquidity issues, and potentially limiting their earnings potential by committing to long-term property investments at a young age.\n\nDepreciation and transaction costs are significant factors that impact property investment decisions. Accurately factoring in depreciation costs, which can range from 5-20% per year depending on the property and area, is crucial to determining the actual return on investment. Additionally, failing to consider transaction costs, which can be 5% or more per sale, as well as capital gains and other taxes, can significantly eat into potential profits from property investments.\n\nRisks associated with property investments, particularly related to liquidity and earnings potential, include the challenge of selling properties in down markets, as they are not as easily traded as stocks and can sit on the market for years. Liquidity issues can lead to forced sales at low prices in situations such as mortgage defaults, potentially resulting in negative equity. Furthermore, property investments can tie individuals to specific locations, limiting their ability to take advantage of new opportunities and potentially hindering their earnings potential, especially in the early stages of their career.\n\nIn summary, it is essential for property investors to carefully consider factors such as depreciation, transaction costs, rental property management requirements, liquidity issues, and potential impacts on earnings potential in order to mitigate risks and make informed investment decisions."}

{"ID": "fiqa_1000", "context": "Three important things worth remembering about Kelly when applied to real world edges: 1) Full Kelly staking is gut wrenchingly volatile. While it maximises the growth of the bankroll, it does so in a way that still leaves you very likely to experience massive (50%+) reductions in capital. Most long terms users of Kelly tend to stick in the 1/4 to 1/2 Kelly unit range to try and stay sane and retain a margin of error. See below for how large the typical swings can be with full Kelly:  2) Garbage in, garbage out. If you are making errors in pricing your actual edge, Kelly becomes very wrong very fast, easily leading you to a high chance of ruin if you are over estimating your true edge. As most people do massively over estimate their edges, Kelly simply pushes them far into territory where risk of ruin is high. 3) A Kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over non likely ones, even to the point where they prefer a smaller % edge if the chances of winning are better. Compare the below comparison of growth between two betting scenarios (decimal odds, so for the percantage chances do 1/odds):  In this case, despite the percentage edge on the red bet being higher than that of the green, in terms of bankroll growth it ends up only being roughly as good to a kelly gambler as the smaller edge on the more likely event. This has an obvious effect on the types of edges you should be seeking out if given choices between liklihoods.", "com_question": "What are the typical swings with full Kelly? How does Kelly handle errors in pricing edges?

It is crucial to accurately assess your edge to avoid such pitfalls when using Kelly staking.\n\nA Kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over unlikely ones.
